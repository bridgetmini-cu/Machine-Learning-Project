The organs may not get enough blood or oxygen when a patient loses a lot of blood. After the patient receives fluids such as blood, plasma, or saline and the bleeding is stopped, blood and oxygen return to the organs. This process called ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) is known to cause injury to organs such as the kidneys and heart. VPA is an approved drug for treating conditions like seizures and migraines for many years. However, it is not approved for use at the higher dose that will be used in this study or for protecting organs from I/R injury. This study will enroll trauma patients and randomly assign them to receive either VPA diluted in salt water or salt water without VPA (placebo) and then follow the patients and compare their organ function and overall outcome. This study is masked meaning that the patients, doctors, and nurses will not know which patient received which treatment. The study treatment will be given in addition to the care that trauma patients normally receive to treat their injuries. The researchers doing this study believe that VPA will lessen organ injury caused by I/R, meaning that patients who receive VPA will experience less kidney injury when compared to patients who receive the placebo.","I/R injury is a critical condition that causes cell damage and organ dysfunction and contributes to morbidity and mortality in a wide range of pathologies. Ischemia is defined as hypoperfusion of tissues, which can occur in conditions such as hemorrhage, sepsis, organ transplantation, and acute coronary syndrome. An imbalance in metabolic supply and demand within the ischemic organ results in tissue hypoxia and microvascular dysfunction. Among trauma patients who have suffered significant blood loss and prolonged hypotension requiring multiple vasopressors, the kidney frequently shows injury due to significant I/R. The rate of acute kidney injury (AKI) in trauma patients is reported to be between 25-30%.

VPA is an anticonvulsant drug that was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1978. VPA was developed for use as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy for the treatment of seizure disorders, mania associated with bipolar disorder, and migraine. Both oral and intravenous (IV) formulations are available. Doses up to 60 milligram (mg)/kilogram (kg)/day for up to 14 days have been demonstrated to be safe and effective. More recently, a study has shown that a single dose of intravenous VPA at up to 140 mg/kg is safe in healthy volunteers. VPA has been recognized as an histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) shown to reduce the inflammatory response and oxidative stress in septic mice, thereby protecting against renal injury. The molecular mechanisms conferring anticonvulsant properties associated with VPA have not been clearly elucidated to date, but likely include increasing levels of γ-aminobutyric acid in the central nervous system (CNS), reduction in N-Methyl-D-Aspartate-mediated excitation, and blockade of voltage gated sodium and L-type calcium channels. More recently, VPA has shown HDACI potential, specifically targeting class I (subclasses Ia and Ib) and class II (subclass IIa) HDAC proteins. Given that VPA modulates multiple pathways involved in AKI, it theoretically could prevent kidney dysfunction and inflammation that is induced by I/R injury.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of VPA on reducing I/R injury related to organ damage in the kidneys in trauma patients with moderate-to-severe hemorrhage. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of VPA on reducing AKI compared with placebo in trauma patients with expected moderated-to-severe hemorrhage at risk for I/R injury. The two secondary objectives are: 1) To assess the post-infusion pharmacokinetics (PK) of VPA in trauma patients with moderate-to-severe hemorrhage at risk of I/R injury, and 2) To evaluate the safety of VPA administered as IV infusion in trauma patients with moderate-to-severe hemorrhage at risk of I/R injury.

This is a phase 2, single-dose, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single dose of 140 mg/kg of VPA plus standard of care (SOC) or the placebo plus SOC, administered via IV infusion within 3 hours (ideally 1 hour) after admittance to the emergency department (ED). Clinical evaluations such as physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram, and laboratory results will be collected. AKI will be used to assess VPA efficacy. Myocardial injury and laboratory measurements (hematology, chemistry, coagulation profile, and urinalysis) will be used to monitor subject safety. Outcome measures including in-hospital mortality, length of intensive care unit (ICU) and/or stepdown unit (SDU) stay, length of hospital stay, number of alive and ventilator free days (aVFD), and incidence of renal replacement therapy (RRT) will also be collected. Blood samples will be collected for PK analysis. The PK analysis will correlate study drug exposures with safety profiles. Specimens (plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and urine) will be stored for future undetermined study-related analyses, including pharmacodynamics (PD) and VPA responsiveness studies. These studies may correlate PK profiles to molecular changes related to beneficial properties of VPA.

Male and non-pregnant, non-breastfeeding female hemorrhaging trauma patients between 18 and 80 years old will be recruited for the study. Trauma patients will be those whose arrival to the ED results in trauma team activation. Only patients who can provide consent or for whom a Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) can provide consent, will be enrolled. Approximately 50 subjects will be recruited from across two major medical centers for participation in this study.

Based on the available safety profile data from multi-dose clinical trials of VPA, the product safety information sheet, as well as the VPA Phase 1 study which evaluated the safety of single ascending doses of VPA, it has been determined that a dose of 140 mg/kg is safe and well-tolerated with minimal adverse reactions. However, given that patients studied at the 140 mg/kg dose in the phase 1 study were relatively healthy compared to the proposed patient population in this study and unanticipated Adverse Events (AEs) may occur, the study team will monitor all study subjects closely for AEs throughout the study. All AEs will be evaluated for duration, seriousness, severity, and relationship to the study drug, and reported accordingly.

This study will be monitored according to the data and safety monitoring plan which will outline the different levels of monitoring and the responsible parties. A Safety Review Committee (SRC) will review and monitor all safety information and compliance data as well as the overall study progress on a regular basis. A Medical Monitor (MM) with relevant clinical and research expertise will oversee the clinical study and provide ongoing medical monitoring. The clinical site Principal Investigators (PIs) will be responsible for ensuring that all AEs that occur in subjects during the AE reporting period are managed and reported in accordance with the protocol, Sponsor requirements, and any applicable regulations and institutional policies. A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will monitor implementation and progress of the study and review the accumulating endpoint and safety data by treatment arm to detect evidence of early significant benefit or harm for subjects while the study is in progress.

As the main purpose of this study is to evaluate safety of VPA in the study population and to investigate efficacy signal, this is a proof-of-concept (PoC) study. Because it is a PoC study rather than a confirmatory one, it has been assumed that a total sample size of 50 subjects (25 in each treatment arm) will be sufficient to provide adequate clinical evidence of safety and potential efficacy, and to support decision-making on whether a larger pivotal confirmatory Phase 3 study would be justified.

A statistical analysis plan (SAP) that details the analytical principles and statistical techniques to be employed in order to address the primary and secondary objectives will be developed. Demographic and relevant baseline characteristics will be presented and summarized descriptively by treatment for the randomized, modified intent-to-treat (mITT), and per-protocol (PP) populations. The primary endpoint of KDIGO stages will be measured in ordinal scale as 0, 1, 2, or 3, where 0 indicates normal renal function and the progressively higher values indicate worsening renal function. The ordinal scale measurements will be analyzed using the proportional odds ordinal logistic regression model. The KDIGO stages will be the dependent variable and drug treatment will be used as the independent variable. The common odds ratio across the KDIGO stages and its 95% confidence interval will be calculated. Binary endpoints (e.g., incidence of AKI) will be analyzed by Fisher's exact test or logistic regression with treatment as an independent variable. The odds ratio and its 95% confidence interval will be calculated. Continuous outcomes will be analyzed by missed effects models with treatment and baseline value of the outcome (if applicable) as independent variables. Un-ordered categorical variables with more than two levels of outcome will be analyzed by a chi-square test. Ordered categorical variables with more than two levels of outcome will be analyzed in the same way as for the primary endpoint. Safety endpoints will be analyzed and summarized descriptively. Categorical variables will be summarized by count and percentage. Odds ratios and relative risks may be calculated to compare study drug with placebo in incidence of certain safety events. Continuous variables will be summarized by mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum. Shift tables may be used to describe changes in certain laboratory values. The plan for the PK analysis is two-fold. First, a standard noncompartmental analysis will be performed to obtain descriptors of VPA exposure to explore potential relationships to the primary outcome), secondary outcomes, or any observed adverse effects. A population PK analysis will be performed to examine and, perhaps, explain the anticipated differing PK of VPA in the trial. Specifically, low protein binding of VPA and massive blood loss are expected to affect the elimination clearance and, perhaps, the volume of distribution of VPA. Characterizing the degree to which the PK are perturbed as well as the parameter variability in this population will be important for analyzing the relationship of VPA exposure to primary and secondary outcomes and determining the effects, if any, of factors related to disease or perioperative conditions to the PK of VPA.

No interim analyses will be performed for this study. This study does not have a formal stopping rule based on statistical testing. See Section 3.9 for more information on stopping rules. Missing data can occur in clinical studies, and they may have an impact on the results of statistical analyses. Every effort will be made to ensure that the amount of missing data is kept at a minimum.","INTERVENTIONAL","RANDOMIZED","PARALLEL","TREATMENT","A phase 2, single-dose, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study",NA,NA,"TRIPLE","In addition to the individuals listed above, Sponsor's representatives such as clinical research associates who will perform site monitoring, the pharmacovigilance medical monitor, and all staff at the research sites other than the pharmacist of record will be masked.",0,"ACTUAL","Inclusion Criteria:

Additionally, recent studies have demonstrated an association between migraine with aura and intracardiac shunting by a patent foramen ovale (PFO) leading to a hypothesis that paradoxical brain embolism of platelets and other undefined chemical substances can play a causal role in migraine with aura (2).

Radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) has been shown to be a promising treatment for cardiac arrhythmias. During catheter ablation, trans-septal puncture (TSP) is routinely performed to gain access to the left heart. TSP causes an iatrogenic atrial septal defect (ASD) with a transient right-to-left shunt which can predispose patients to stroke and migraine (3). In two different studies, with 571 and 183 patients in whom TSP was performed, the incidence of migraine was 0.5% and 2.2% respectively and the migraine was transient and resolved without any sequelae (2, 3). In separate studies, complete resolution or improvement of migraine was noticed with the ASD/PFO closure (4). Additional case-studies have also reported AF occurring during episodes of migraine with aura where the cardiac rhythm was normal between the episodes (5). All these reports evidently demonstrate an association between AF, TSP during RFCA and migraine, but fail to clearly define the nature of it. It is not yet understood whether a successful catheter ablation of AF has any impact on the natural course of pre-existing or newly-occurring migraine. This study aims at exploring the relationship between AF and migraine and to evaluate if an effective ablation therapy for AF influences the incidence and clinical presentation of migraine in patients with or without a previous history.

Several isolated case-studies have reported improvement in the frequency and severity of migraine during treatment with Coumadin (6, 7). Coumadin is routinely prescribed to patients undergoing RFCA to prevent thrombo-embolic events. Our study would further explore the impact of therapeutic Coumadin on the prevalence and clinical course of migraine in patients with a previous history.

Menopausal symptoms including hot flushes, vaginal dryness and mood swings are experienced by about 80% of Chinese women aged 45 to 60. In the past year, 235 patients visited CMCTR(ND), a TCM center set up by HA and operated by HKFTU Workers' Medical Clinics since 2008, suffered from PMS.

According to literature review, high proportion of clinical trials regarding perimenopausal women used fixed formula treatment. However, different constitutional types were found in perimenopausal women and different fixed formulae were used in different research. Apart from kidney yin deficiency, perimenopausal women were also found in liver-kidney yin deficiency, kidney yang deficiency, kidney yin and yang deficiency, disharmony between heart and kidney, liver qi stagnation, etc. It is difficult to draw a conclusion that any single fixed formula could have the best efficacy on PMS. Therefore, it is worth studying to see whether syndrome differentiation would be a better choice for PMS treatment.

Objective: The study aims to evaluate whether syndrome differentiated treatment is better than fixed formula (Er-Xian decoction) treatment for perimenopausal women.

Design: This is a pilot single-blinded, randomized controlled trial.

Participants: Chinese women aged 45-55 year with menstruation abnormalities (menstrual irregularity in past 12 months; or menstrual period off at least twice in past 12 months; or amenorrhea of 2 to 12 months); also suffering any following perimenopausal symptoms: vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes, sweats), psychological symptoms (insomnia, migraine, irritability), or genitourinary symptoms (vaginal dryness, dyspareunia)

Interventions: A randomized controlled trial will be conducted to assess the efficacy of syndrome differentiated treatment versus a fixed formula (Er-Xian decoction) in treating PMS. 100 participants will be randomly divided into 2 groups. Intervention group of participants will be given medication by syndrome differentiating from qualified TCM Practitioners while the control group of participants will be given a fixed formula.

Outcome measures: Primary assessments outcome measure is the Kupperman Index, and the secondary outcome measure is MENQOL questionnaire.","Perimenopausal syndrome is also known as menopausal syndrome. Menopause Syndrome refers to women due to ovarian dysfunction or loss of estrogen causing a variety of systemic dysfunctions in the body, including the autonomic nervous system, dysfunction and metabolic disorders-based symptoms such as hot flushes and sweating, sleep disorders, depression, multiple joint pains, headache, dizziness, fatigue, etc. These symptoms seriously affect menopausal women . Modern medical treatment of perimenopausal syndrome mainly focus on Hormonal Therapy (HT). Studies have shown that the clinical effect of hormonal therapy would quickly relieve the symptoms of perimenopausal syndrome, including urogenital atrophy and prevention of osteoporosis .

However there were some scholars believed that although short-term use of hormone supplement therapy could relieve the symptoms of perimenopausal women, the role of estrogen treatment in postmenopausal women still needed to be further explored . The reason was that hormonal replacement therapy can cause more adverse reactions and potential risks such as increased cardiovascular disease, cerebral infarction, breast-related diseases, risk of embolism in veins and lungs and other diseases .

In the previous study, the investigators found that the Chinese herbal formula Er-Xian decoction was superior to placebo in reducing the frequency and severity of hot flushes and in relieving menopausal symptoms in Hong Kong perimenopausal women. It was well tolerated, with no serious adverse events noted during the study period. The study proved the effectiveness of traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of menopausal symptoms. The investigators designed this experiment in order to further understand the effectiveness between syndrome differentiation treatment and fixed prescription.

Syndrome differentiation and treatment is the process of recognizing and resolving diseases, the embodiment of the combination of theory and practice, the specific clinical application of principles and methods, and the basic principles guiding the clinical work of traditional Chinese medicine. Dialectics is the process of authentication. Syndrome is a summary of the pathological reflections of the body through four diagnostic methods (inspection, listening and smelling, inquiries, and palpation ). It would help to establish disease stages, including the location of disease, cause, nature, and relationship between healthy qi and pathogenic qi. Therefore, the syndrome would reveal the essence of the disease, and therefore enhance the disease management. Corresponding treatment method is determined based on the result of syndrome differentiation. Syndrome differentiation and treatment are two inseparable parts in the process of diagnosis and treatment of diseases.

There is no record of the term of the perimenopausal syndrome in the ancient Chinese medicine books. The investigators can find some similar symptoms recorded in ""Lily Disease"" , ""Hysteria"", and ""Insomnia""or ""Depression"" and other diseases in ancient books. Modern Chinese medicine gynecology calls it ""Premenopausal"". Traditional Chinese medicine believes that in perimenopausal women, the kidney qi is gradually declining. Dysfunction of qi and blood is mainly caused by kidney deficiency. Among them, the syndrome of kidney yin deficiency is the most common. According to the literature, the syndrome types are divided as follows:

1. Liver and Kidney Yin Deficiency Syndrome: Before and after menstruation, the essence and blood are weak, or the body is in yin deficiency, yin does not guard the yang, yang is disturbed. Clinical symptoms include sweating, hot flushes, insomnia, forgetfulness, backache and weak legs, dry genitals, menstrual disorders, red tongue with less coating, pulse is rapid and thready. Suggested Formula: Gan Mai Bai He Di Hung Tang
2. Non Interaction Between Heart and Kidney:The woman's yin and yang are imbalanced, the yin essence is deficient, and the kidney yin deficiency and water does not nourish the wood, causing the liver fire to become prosperous. Common clinical symptoms include hot flush, sweating, palpitation, irritability, bitter mouth, dry mouth, red tongue with thin yellow coating, pulse is thready and rapid. Suggested formula: Tian Wang Bu Xin Dan
3. Liver stagnation and qi stagnation syndrome: Chest tightness, hypotension, chest pain, mental depression, nervousness, abdominal pain, flushing, nervousness, petechial, chord pulse. Suggested formula: Shugan Granules (Danzhi Xiaoyao San without Ginger add Xiangfu)
4. Kidney Yin Deficiency Syndrome: Fever, sweating, upset, Insomnia, dry mouth, ant feeling on the skin, early menstruation. Suggested formula: Liu Wei Di Huang Pill and Er Zhi Pill

Children and adolescents with migraine often present to the emergency department (ED) with acute attacks, where migraine accounts for up to \~30% of all pediatric ED visits for headache. Based on the limited evidence, many centers have adopted protocols whereby children and adolescents who visit the ED with acute attacks of migraine are treated with an IV neuroleptic (metoclopramide or prochlorperazine) and an IV non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (ketorolac). This combination of interventions is largely considered to be standard of care despite no rigorous evidence to support this practice. Side effect rates with the neuroleptics (metoclopramide or prochlorperazine) are considerable, and IV catheters are associated with high adverse event and failure rates in children and adolescents. Therefore, the current standard of care for managing children and adolescents visiting the ED with acute attacks of migraine poses concern to patients and is associated with significant pain and frequent side effects.

Emerging neuromodulation devices show promise for expanding acute treatment options. Over the past few years, there has been a growth in research investigating the efficacy and safety of non-invasive neuromodulation, which delivers electrical or magnetic stimulation to nerves or neural tissue, for the management of acute attacks of migraine. At present, there are 3 commercially available, non-invasive neuromodulation devices that effectively and safely treat acute attacks of migraine in adults. Because none of these devices have a high level evidence in children, adolescents, nor in the ED setting, there is clinical equipoise as to which device would be most appropriate to study for treating children and adolescents visiting the ED with acute attacks. Throughout our patient engagement work, children and adolescents with migraine have identified that they are interested in trying remote electrical neuromodulation for treating migraine attacks in the ED.

The investigators propose a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) that will determine the feasibility and acceptability of executing a phase III RCT, in which children and adolescents visiting the ED with acute attacks of migraine will be randomized to REN or standard of care IV treatment, and then crossed over to the other treatment arm if the initial intervention is not effective.","One in ten Canadian children and adolescents suffer from migraine, and visits to the pediatric emergency department (ED) for acute attacks are common, with over 2,500 annual visits in Alberta alone. Evidence-based acute management options for children and adolescents presenting to the ED with acute attacks of migraine are limited. The current standard of care, which comprises a combination of a neuroleptic (metoclopramide) and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (ketorolac), has a low level of evidence and is administered through an intravenous (IV) cannula. However, at least half of children and adolescents presenting to the ED with acute attacks of migraine would prefer to avoid an IV, and these standard of care migraine interventions have substantial side effects and costs. The Nerivio remote electrical neuromodulation (REN) device is a novel, non-invasive, wearable REN device that is applied to the arm using an armband and wirelessly controlled by a smartphone software application. REN has established efficacy and safety for the treatment of acute attacks of migraine in adults, and preliminary open-label efficacy and safety data for use in adolescents. Through user engagement efforts, the investigators have identified that children and adolescents with migraine and ED providers are interested in trying REN to treat refractory acute attacks in the ED.

The investigators are proposing a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) that will aim to determine the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a phase III RCT, in which children and adolescents visiting the ED with acute attacks of migraine will be randomized to REN, or to standard of care IV treatment in a double-dummy crossover design. Participants will be crossed over to the other treatment arm if the initial intervention is not effective. The objectives of the investigators are:

1. To determine the feasibility of comparing REN to the standard of care IV intervention (i.e., a combination of metoclopramide and ketorolac) for the treatment of children and adolescents visiting the ED with acute attacks of migraine.
2. To determine the acceptability of the study design and of using REN to treat children and adolescents visiting the ED with acute attacks of migraine.
3. To gather preliminary efficacy and safety data on the use of REN to treat children and adolescents visiting the ED with acute attacks of migraine (for both the initial assigned intervention and the crossover intervention where applicable).

The investigators propose to carry out a pilot RCT to determine the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a double-dummy, crossover RCT protocol. In this pilot study, children and adolescents visiting the ED with acute attacks of migraine will be randomized to initially receive either REN or standard of care IV treatment (i.e. a combination of metoclopramide and ketorolac). Each group will also receive a blinded control (either normal saline through the IV for the REN group, or sham stimulation for the standard of care IV group). Consenting participants will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to either REN or standard of care IV treatment. The allocation sequence will be sent to the research pharmacy and will not be accessible to anyone involved in the study or patient care. The REN group will receive active stimulation and normal saline placebo that will appear identical in appearance and volume to the medications given to the comparison group. The comparison group will receive a combination of pharmaceutical interventions that are considered to be the standard of care for treating children and adolescents visiting the ED with migraine: IV metoclopramide and IV ketorolac. The comparison group will also receive sham stimulation that will be low enough that it cannot induce conditioned pain modulation, the mechanism of action of REN, but it will be perceptible and similar to the sensation induced by the REN device. Stimulation for both groups occurs over 45 minutes. Participants will be assessed 120 minutes following the initial intervention and will be crossed over to the other treatment arm if the initial intervention is not effective. Efficacy and safety outcomes will be measured at baseline, 60 minutes, and 120 minutes (for both the initial and crossover study interventions as applicable), as well as 48 hours post-intervention.","INTERVENTIONAL","RANDOMIZED","CROSSOVER","TREATMENT","The investigators will carry out a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to determine the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a double-dummy, crossover RCT protocol.",NA,NA,"TRIPLE","Participants, research staff, and clinical staff, including the investigator, research assistant, research nurse, and attending physician, will remain blind to the study interventions.",40,"ESTIMATED","Inclusion Criteria:

The secondary objectives are to examine the side effects associated with BTA treatment and the impact this treatment has on patients' quality of life.","Introduction:

Non-neurogenic urinary urge incontinence (UUI) is a common quality of life disorder that becomes more prevalent with age. It is described as a condition that causes people to feel an ""urgent"" need to urinate due to muscle spasms in the bladder. Factors such as infection, inflammation, strokes, and dementia can stimulate the bladder to create spasms and cause urine loss. Overactive bladder refers to the symptom complex of urinary frequency, urgency and or nocturia with or without incontinence. Overactive bladder is a disorder of the storage phase of the bladder affecting approximately 16.9% of the US women, increasing to 31% after age 75. Standard treatment for UUI includes behavior modification, pelvic floor exercises, anticholinergic medication, and less commonly, sacral neuromodulation. Unfortunately anticholinergic therapy is only moderately effective and causes bothersome side effects, particularly at higher doses. Sacral neuromodulation therapy is currently unavailable in Saskatchewan with the closest treatment centre being located in Calgary.

Botulinum toxin A (BTA or Botox©) may be a useful treatment in patients that do not respond to standard therapy. Botulinum toxin A has been used in other studies to improve symptoms in neurogenic urinary incontinence, migraines following spinal cord injuries, and a variety of lower urinary tract disorders. This product has been approved by FDA for treatments of the following conditions: two eye muscle disorders (blepharospasm and strabismus in December 1989), severe underarm sweating (primary axillary hyperhydrosis), brow furrow and frown lines (April 2002) and other cosmetic purposes (July 2004). For the treatment of UUI, BTA is injected into the detrusor muscle of the bladder which is the muscle of the bladder that squeezes urine towards the outlet. BTA has been used in other studies to improve the symptoms in urinary incontinence and a variety of lower urinary tract disorders, however, the treatment for non-neurogenic urinary urge incontinence has not been examined in a well-controlled study.

Research Purpose and Objectives:

The primary purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of BTA in the treatment of non-neurogenic UUI. The secondary objectives are to examine the side effects associated with BTA treatment and the impact this treatment has on patients' quality of life.

Research Methods:

This study employs a 12 month, double-blinded, randomized, partial cross-over design. The first 6 months of the study, subjects will be randomized to receive either detrusor injection of BTA or a placebo injection. In the remaining six months, subjects in the control group will be offered the detrusor injection of BTA. All 36 subjects will be followed for the remaining 6 months.

Study Procedures and Protocol

Pre-injection Assessment:

The pre-injection and assessment stage includes an evaluation of the medical history and physical exam. Previous therapy and medication will be disclosed to the physician. The investigator will ensure the subject meets the inclusion criteria, has had urinalysis and a pregnancy test if under 50 years old.

Day of the Procedure:

On the day of the surgery, the study pharmacist will randomize subjects using a random numbers table. The study doctor, nurses, and subjects will be blinded to treatment allocation. Ancef 1gm, or in the case of penicillin allergy, cipro 400 mg, will be given by intravenous.

A local anaesthetic will be instilled at the end of the cystoscopy (40 ml 1% lidocaine) and sedation will be provided as required. Fifteen minutes will lapse before beginning the procedure.

Using a 30 degree rigid scope and minimally invasive cystoscopic technique, 10 injections at 10 U/ml per injection (altogether 100 U of BTA) will be injected into the bladder wall, sparing the trigone.3,4 Subjects assigned to the placebo condition will receive injections of a saline at a similar frequency as the BTA injections.

Subjects will be observed for 60 minutes post procedure and then discharged home. This is the standard protocol for other BTA procedures performed on an outpatient basis in the RQHR. Catheter supplies will be provided upon discharge.

Follow-up Schedule:

1. Four to Six Weeks Post-Procedure: The primary and secondary measures will be assessed.
2. Three Months post-procedure: The same procedures will be repeated as at the four-to-six week assessment.
3. Six Months post-procedure: The four-to-six week assessment will be performed, and symptoms of retention or residual since the last visit will be discussed. A cystoscopy will be performed to study culture/urinalysis, measure desire and capacity, and show incontinence. Study allocation will be revealed at six months, and BTA injection will be offered to subjects that had received the placebo.
4. Nine Months: The four-to-six week procedures are repeated.
5. Twelve Months: The four-to-six week procedures are repeated.

Potential Significance:

Current anticholinergic therapy for non neurogenic UUI has limitations. In addition to significant systemic side effects, studies have shown that only 50% of patients improve with anticholinergic therapy, and that improvement does not always involve continence. Thus, detrusor injection of BTA may be a safe and efficacious therapy for patients who have failed standard therapy with anticholinergic medication and allow for an improved quality of life.","INTERVENTIONAL","RANDOMIZED","CROSSOVER","TREATMENT",NA,NA,NA,"DOUBLE",NA,21,"ACTUAL","Inclusion Criteria:

It is the tenth cranial nerve originating from the medulla oblongata in the central nervous system and is the longest cranial nerve. It starts from the medulla and progresses to the colon. It mainly innervates the thoracic and abdominal organs. It has an obvious effect on the autonomic nervous system, especially on parasympathetic activity. When the literature is examined, it has been proven by various studies that vagus nerve stimulation has effects on the regulation of the autonomic system. Vagus nerve stimulation with different methods has been investigated over the years and the effectiveness of several different methods has been proven. There are both invasive and non-invasive (transcutaneous) techniques for vagus nerve stimulation. The first experiments were developed on invasive applications, and then non-invasive applications began to emerge.

Today, the most used devices and stimulation models were approved by the FDA in the 1990s for use in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. In the middle of the first decade of the 2000s, the FDA approved the use of these devices for drug-resistant depression. These application methods have therapeutic effects for a wide variety of conditions, including heart failure, obesity, migraine, Alzheimer's, inflammation, chronic pain, and tinnitus. Invasive intervention is not necessary to perform this procedure. Direct stimulation of afferent nerve fibers in the ear can produce a similar effect without surgical intervention. Non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation may affect human physiology and be a simple and inexpensive alternative to invasive vagus stimulation. It has been shown on different subjects that non-invasive stimulation of the tragus in the ear increases the activation in the parasympathetic system and decreases the sympathetic activity. This indicates that tragus stimulation may be a viable treatment for some disorders in which autonomic activity is compromised.

While the general mechanism has been explained in this way, there is no definite information in the literature about which ear from the right single ear, double ear or left single ear will be applied in Transcutaneous Auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation applications. While specifying the application techniques, an objective scientific study about whether there is a difference between Unilateral Right, Unilateral Left and Bilateral Applications or which of them gives more effective results will be a guide for further studies. The purpose of the study, planning to carry out is to seek an answer to one of the questions that come to mind for standardization. The main question we seek to answer is whether there is a difference between Unilateral Right, Unilateral Left and Bilateral Applications while specifying the application techniques, or which of them gives more effective results.

This study had been approved by the Researchers Ethics Committee of the ""Pugliese-Ciaccio"" Hospital (protocol number 720/2010; EUDRACT NUMBER 2012-005737-36), and was conducted following the Declaration of Helsinki and the Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice criteria.

Population Children with migraine without aura (MoA) of both sexes aged from 5 to 16 years, with at least four attacks /month, were eligible for the study. MoA was diagnosed according to the criteria for pediatric age of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (IHS-2) \[22\].

Exclusion criteria were the following: mental retardation (IQ \<70), genetic syndromes (e.g., Down syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, fragile X syndrome), hypothyroidism, psychiatric disorders (i.e.: schizophrenia, mood disorders, ADHD), neuromuscular disorders, epilepsy, obesity (BMI\>95 percentiles), liver or renal diseases, gastrointestinal disorders such as peptic or duodenal ulcer, dyspepsia, or heartburn; hypersensitivity to medication studies.

Informed written consent was obtained by parents.

Experimental protocol In a balanced recruitment study eligible outpatients with primary acute migraine were assigned to receive at pain onset: acetaminophen (15mg/kg) or ibuprofen (10mg/kg). Moreover, in order to evaluate the prophylaxis effect of magnesium in another set of experiments eligible children were assigned to receive a daily magnesium supplement (400 mg/daily) and then one single dose of acetaminophen (15mg/kg) or ibuprofen (10 mg/kg) at the time of pain (Figure 1). In this study, in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki (1991), we did not use a placebo group.

In each group, children were assigned in accordance to age, gender in order to obtain similar groups of treatment.

In order to assess the intensity of pain, before and up to 3 hours after the administration of both drugs used in the present protocol, a non standardized ad hoc scale and a visual analogical scale (VAS) were used.

Specifically, for the pre-dose assessments, the pain intensity was measured on an arbitrarily established categoric scales in response to the question, ""What is your pain level at this time?"" with response choices from 0 to 3, where 0 = none; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; and 3 = severe. In addition, a visual analogical scale (VAS) was used to assess pain severity before, during and after the treatment. Patients were asked to draw a single vertical line on the 100-mm VAS, where 0 = no pain (score 0) and 100 mm = worst pain (score 10). This scale had been previously used to measure pain in pediatric populations .

The safety on medication studies was assessed in terms of frequency and nature of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). In order to evaluate the association between ADRs and drug treatment, the Naranjo Adverse Probability Scale was applied .

Number, duration, severity of pain attacks, analgesic intake and the occurrence of ADRs were recorded in a daily diary card 1 month prior to the trial and subsequently during the entire period of the study.

However, only few studies have evaluated the rapid pain improvement provided by medications in the acute management of headaches in the pediatric population.

Objective : To evaluate pain reduction provided by intranasal fentanyl (INF) compared to placebo in addition to ibuprofen for children presenting to a pediatric ED with moderate to severe headaches.

Methods : A single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled clinical trial will be conducted in an urban, university-affiliated, tertiary care pediatric hospital ED. All children eight to 18 years old who will present to the ED with headaches as a main chief complaint and with pain of ≥ 36 mm out of 100 on Visual Analog Scale (VAS) will be recruited. Study participants will be randomly allocated to receive INF 1.5 mcg/kg (maximum dose of 100 mcg) or similar volume of a placebo solution via an atomizer. Co-administration of oral ibuprofen 10 mg/kg (maximum dose of 600 mg) will also be provided to the two groups if not received in the previous 4 hours. The primary outcome will be the mean pain rating reduction at 15 minutes. The secondary outcomes will be mean pain reduction at 30 and 60 minutes, patient's and parental satisfaction levels, percent of being pain free, sedation score, immediate and within 72 hours adverse events, additional ED analgesics and other medications, length of ED stay, disposition outcomes, hospital admission rate and ED revisit rate within 72 hours. The primary analysis will use an intention-to-treat approach to compare mean pain score reduction between the two groups using a Student's T-test. The sample size of 60 participants per arm was calculated to have a power of 80% to identify a difference of 10 mm in the VAS.

Expected results : Our study might demonstrate that INF provides additional pain relief for children presenting to an ED with headaches. Providing INF could relieve their symptoms more quickly, potentially improve patient's and family's satisfaction, possibly reduce the length of their ED stay and consequently, have a significant impact on patient quality of care and cost-effectiveness.","The primary objective of the present study would be to determine the additive value on analgesic effectiveness of INF in children aged eight to 18 years with acute moderate to severe headaches. We would also aim to gather information on the safety and acceptability of INF for headaches. We believe that providing INF for moderate to severe headaches will decrease pain levels in children aged 8 to 18 years old.

We will perform a prospective, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial.

The study setting will be a single center, urban, university-based, tertiary care pediatric university-affiliated hospital ED with an annual census of 75,000 patient visits. The study should be conducted between 2015-2018.

Study population : Inclusion criteria will consist of children aged eight to 18 years who present to the pediatric ED with a chief complaint of headaches, regardless of the type, with a moderate or severe pain score. Pain was considered at least moderate if superior or equal to 36 mm on the VAS as demonstrated by Hirschfeld et. Al. This level have been chosen because it has been recognized that adequate sensitivity in analgesia trials for acute pain can only be obtained if patients experience at least moderate pain before administration of any treatment.

Intervention: All patients will receive a 1.5 mcg⁄kg dose of fentanyl or an equivalent volume of similar looking placebo. This will be administered intranasally via a mucosal atomiser device (MAD) using 50 mcg/mL solution with a 2 mL syringe. Prior studies have shown that this dose is as effective as IV or IM morphine and provides a bioavailability which is 71% of the IV dose. The minimum dose prescribed will be 20 mcg, to ensure delivery of 15 mcg of fentanyl to a 10 kg child, allowing for the MAD dead space of 0.1 mL (5 mcg of fentanyl). For analgesic dose-volumes equal to and less than 0.5 mL, the entire dose will be administered in one nostril; doses above 0.5 mL will be divided equally and administered to both nostrils. Concentrated medications in a small volume (0.2-0.3 mL per nostril) are ideal, whereas volumes in excess of 1 mL per nostril are not reliably absorbed as a result of mucosal surface saturation and runoff from the nasal cavity. The maximum dose administered will be 100 mcg due to volume constraints. The placebo solution will consist of normal saline that would be delivered via the proposed atomiser. The value administered will be adjusted to the patients weight as for the active study medication. No additional dose of either study medication would be provided. A MAD have been chosen because it is suggested to increase the mucosal coverage and absorption of the medication by atomizing particles and decreasing the amount of medication lost due to swallowing.

Oral ibuprofen (10 mg/kg) (maximum dose of 600 mg) will also be administered within the first 15 minutes of intranasal administration of the study medication unless it had been given in the previous 4 hours. It has been chosen over acetaminophen because a direct comparison has shown that complete pain relief after two hours is achieved twice as frequently with ibuprofen.

The randomization process will occur at the local pharmacy and randomization allotment will be known only by a pharmacist who is not involved in the study. Therefore, all providers involved in the patient's care and patients will be blinded to group assignment until data analysis completion. The participant will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups as follows : 1) INF 1.5 mcg/kg and 2) placebo solution, given via an atomizer (MAD device: MAD Nasal, U.S. Patent #6,112,743, Wolfe-Tory Medical, Inc., 79 West 4500 South, Salt Lake City, Utah 84107).

The study medications will be provided to the ED by the local pharmacy. For each randomized patient, a consecutive study medication package will be opened in the ED. Each study package will contain a study medication (either generic fentanyl bottle or saline bottle), a syringe and an atomizer for delivery. An on-site nurse will withdraw the study medication from the specific bottle provided in the package and will deliver the study medication to the patient. The study research assistant will remain blinded. At the pharmacy, the patient's identification will be coded so that only a user having the access code will be able to identify participants.

Procedure : Every patient will be weighed in triage. Enrollment will be limited to times when a research assistant is available. A research assistant will recruit the patients after a pediatric ED physician has assessed them and once the symptoms of headaches are clearly established. The pain associated with headaches will be assessed by using the VAS, which has been validated for the use in children aged eight years and older across a variety of clinical settings and has an excellent interrater-reliability and validity in analgesia research.

Once eligibility and exclusion criteria will be confirmed, caregivers will be given written and verbal study information. Written consent for enrolment will be gained from both the accompanying parent and the child, when appropriate. The research assistant will use timers to coordinate all the events. At baseline, before any intervention, the VAS score, baseline vital signs and sedation score (UMSS) will be recorded by the research assistant. For the assessment of the VAS score, the children will be asked to mark on a standardized data collection booklet, the level of their pain on a 100-mm non hatched VAS scale with at one end ""no pain"" and at the other ""worst pain ever"" with the following, verbatim: ""Show me on the line the level of your pain: here is no pain; there is the worst possible pain."" The patient will then cross a line to indicate his or her level of pain. All measurements will be recorded to the closest 1 mm.

At time zero, the solution contained in a syringe will be administered by the on-site nurse to the anterior aspect of the participant's nasal cavity over few seconds. The dose (or half of it, if necessary) will be administered into one of the patient's nostrils with the MAD. The second half of the dose, if needed, will be administered in the contralateral nostril using the same MAD. Younger children will have the medication administered while sitting in the lap of a parent, with their heads reclined and necks hyperextended. Older children will receive the medication while lying in a semi recumbent position on the gurney. No additional dose would be provided. The research assistant will remain blinded to which medication the patient has received.

At the fifteenth, thirtieth and sixtieth minute post-intervention, the research assistant will obtain a pain score via the VAS from the patient and ask for the change in their pain. They will be asked to give a verbal rating of their pain as 'a lot less', 'a little less', 'the same', 'a little more' or 'a lot more' compared to the initial baseline, at time zero and reassess level of pain on the VAS as used previously. Children will not be permitted to refer to previous scales markings and will remain blinded to their prior scores. The sedation score will also be recorded using the University of Michigan Sedation Scale (UMSS) which overall validity was demonstrated and declared as a simple, valid and reliable tool that facilitates rapid and frequent assessment and documentation of depth of sedation in children. The vital signs will also be taken at these intervals.

A detailed demographic and clinical data will also be collected after the study medication administration. A standardized questionnaire of the patient's present and past headaches, will be completed by the research assistant during their stay in the pediatric ED. The questionnaire will include questions on duration, location, description of pain, associated symptoms of the present headache and past medical history.

No other meds, IV fluids, IV procedures or other painful procedures will be done during the study period unless the patient's condition changes or deteriorates. If any of these procedure is needed during the study period, the patient will be withdrawn from the study and will be treated according of his state of health.

At the sixtieth minute of the study, marking the end of the study, patients who had assented to the study and parents will be asked to rate their satisfaction on the efficacy of the study medication on a Likert scale ('strongly disagree' 'disagree', 'neither agree nor disagree', 'agree', or 'strongly agree'). This satisfaction scale will be given to patients and parents after the last pain score was obtained. The study would be then completed, and further care will be at the discretion of the attending pediatric ED medical staff.

A follow-up call by a research assistant will be done at 72 hours after discharge to assess headache recurrence, late medication side effects, and a return to another medical facility. All children hospitalized will also be reached.

A chart review will be done by a member of the research team to collect final pediatric ED diagnosis as well as any additional investigations (e.g. CT scan, consultation with a neurologist, blood tests, TSH, etc.).

Data will be collected using pediatric ED medical records of recruited patients and the sociodemographic questionnaire completed by a research assistant. The results of all other variables: VAS, UMSS and satisfaction score will be collected in real time by the research assistant during the pediatric ED stay.

A data collection form will be used, and these forms will be later cross-referenced with the patient's clinical records by a member of the research team to verify correct documentation and eligibility.

Sample size and statistics :

This is the first study evaluating pain related to all types of headaches in children. Accordingly, no previous study perfectly matches our design to infer sample size. However, two previous studies evaluated an intervention provided to decrease acute pain secondary to migraine in children using the VAS. These studies reported a standard deviation of 18.5 and 20 mm. Powell et al found the minimum clinically significant difference (MCSD) in VAS pain score for children aged 8 to 15 years (on a 100-mm VAS scale) to be 10 mm (95% confidence interval 7 to 12 mm). In studies of populations, differences of less than this amount, even if statistically significant, are unlikely to be of clinical significance. Previous research in adults has found the same MCSD in VAS pain scores and did not differ in adults with age, sex, or cause of pain. Based on these data, using an alpha value of 0,05 and a power of 80%, it was estimated that we need, 57 patients per group. Accounting to a maximal 5% drop-off rate, we inflated this number to 60 participants per group.

All data will be entered in an excel database (Microsoft Inc., Richmond, WA) and will be analyzed with SPSS v21 (IBM Inc). The primary study analysis will be a Student's T-test to compare the mean differences in scores between the intervention group and the placebo group. An intention-to-treat approach will be used. Also, secondary analyses will be performed using a Student's T-test for continuous variables and a Pearson Chi-square test for categorical variables. The 95% confidence intervals will be measured for each result.","INTERVENTIONAL","RANDOMIZED","PARALLEL","TREATMENT",NA,NA,NA,"QUADRUPLE",NA,62,"ACTUAL","Inclusion Criteria:

- Inclusion criteria will consist of children aged eight to 18 years who present to the pediatric ED with a chief complaint of headaches, regardless of the type, with a moderate or severe pain score.

Pain was considered at least moderate if superior or equal to 36 mm on the VAS as demonstrated by Hirschfeld et. Al. This level have been chosen because it has been recognized that adequate sensitivity in analgesia trials for acute pain can only be obtained if patients experience at least moderate pain before administration of any treatment.

Thus, it emerges the necessity of new techniques to treat these group of diseases, such as the transcranial electrical stimulation (tES). This procedure induces a low-intensity electrical current through the scalp to modify the excitability of brain cells, thus facilitating changes in neural networks which may be dysfunctional in some chronic pain patients.

The main objective of this research is to test the efficacy of two tES techniques, differentiated by applying direct or alternant electrical current, to reduce the pain intensity and to increase pain thresholds of these patients. Besides, intervention is implemented at home for patients themselves thanks to a portable and convenient stimulator device, after one training session provided by technicians. Researches can supervise the compliance of the treatment remotely, as the stimulator has a permanent connection with their computers. A home-based approach means a more comfortable and accessible treatment alternative for patients, since they do not have to attend to clinics everyday to receive the stimulation; the advantages become even more relevant in the pandemic context, since the risk of being infected is radically minimized.

Despite the main purpose is to test the efficacy of tES to improve the pain suffered by patients, many other areas are considered as secondary end points for being intrinsically linked or affected by the disease, such as the interference in daily tasks provoked by pain, mood disorders (depression/anxiety), fatigue, life quality, physical functioning and sleep quality; these last two variables are measured with actigraph wristwatches, apart from specific questionnaires. Lastly, endogenous modulatory pain mechanisms are examined through sensory tests, namely Conditioned Pain Modulation and Temporal Summation of pain.","This work aims to provide answers to the refractory chronic pain challenge. Pain is defined as refractory when multiple evidence-based biomedical therapies have failed to reach treatment goals that may include adequate pain reduction and/or improvement in daily functioning, even after appropriately assessing and addressing those psychosocial factors that could influence pain outcomes. In this sense, on the one hand, the study focus on detecting central biomarkers of pain modulation and processing which will contribute to improving knowledge of the mechanisms of pain chronification and the diagnosis procedure. On the other hand, given the low efficacy of pharmacological or non-pharmacological therapies for the patients studied, the efficacy of new therapeutic alternatives (tES) is explored. In short, the project will allow the transfer of knowledge to clinical practice in several aspects, such as diagnosis or treatment.

Therefore, the research aims to test the role of defective central pain modulation/processing as explanatory mechanisms for chronic pain. A second main objective is to test the efficacy of transcranial electric stimulation (tES) to modify dysfunction of central mechanism of pain, and to improve symptoms and quality of life in refractory chronic pain patients.

To achieve this, the investigators will select valid and reliable instruments to assess pain and comorbid symptoms in chronic pain patients and the most sensitive outcome measures to assess tES treatment efficacy. Sensory testing paradigms, namely Conditioned Pain Modulation, Temporal Summation of Second Pain and pain-related evoked potentials using electroencephalographic recordings, will act as biomarkers which are proposed to correlate with the severity of the chronic pain disease or some of their symptoms, and also as predictors of the treatment outcome.

Total sample includes 120 patients with refractory pharmaco-resistant pain, attended at the Pain Units of two Public Galician Hospitals (36 male, 84 female).

Vestibular Migraine (VM), a newly recognized type of migraine that causes bouts of dizziness.

University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and The Mayo Clinic is seeking people with VM to participate in a research study. The purpose of this study is to look at the natural history of VM and learn more about common symptoms. Investigators also want to learn the effects, both positive and negative, of the commonly used migraine drug, rizatriptan, when it is used for spells of dizziness in people with VM.

These diseases have few therapeutic methods due to poorly understood pathophysiology. For migraine and angina, the vascular exploration is problematic unlike for primary Raynaud's phenomenon (RP).

Primary Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) is a common peripheral vascular disease to cold with an estimated prevalence between 5-9 % of the general population.

The identification of these pathways will be made by the detection of genetic abnormalities causing vasospasm in Raynaud's phenomenon.

A single 2.5 mg/kg dose of bevacizumab will be given intra-arterially after osmotic blood-brain-barrier disruption.","BACKGROUND Radiation Necrosis: Stereotactic radiosurgery has become integral in treatment of brain tumors and arteriovenous malformations (AVM). In up to 10% of cases, this can lead to radiation necrosis (RN) with significant surrounding vasogenic edema and mass effect. Medical treatment for RN includes steroids, vitamin E, pentoxiphylline, and hyperbaric oxygen. Up to 20% of cases however, are medically refractory and experience progressive neurological decline and disabling headaches.

Surgical resection and laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) are sometimes used for treatment of medically refractory radiation necrosis. These invasive options carry risks of serious complications such as infection, seizures, neurological deficits, and hemorrhage, and may have a failure rate as high as 39% in patients with radiation necrosis of the brain.

Bevacizumab: Bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech BioOncology, South San Francisco, CA) is a recombinant humanized version of a murine anti-human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) monoclonal antibody. Recently, bevacizumab was shown in a small randomized controlled trial (n=14) to be effective in treatment of refractory radiation necrosis after radiation therapy in brain tumors1. Patients received 7.5 mg/kg IV-Bevacizumab every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. All patients receiving Bevacizumab and none of the patients receiving placebo had significant clinical and radiographic improvement.

PRE-CLINICAL DATA Role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in radiation necrosis VEGF has been implicated in the pathophysiology of radiation necrosis. Reactive astrocytes immediately surrounding the necrotic core in RN are strongly VEGF-positive by immunohistochemistry. It is postulated that radiation causes microvascular injury leading to hypoxia. Hypoxia-induced VEGF up-regulation then drives an increase in vascular permeability, leading to the extensive vasogenic edema seen in RN. Bevacizumab binds circulating VEGF receptors with high specificity, blocking the down-stream signaling cascade.

CLINICAL DATA:

Bevacizumab was originally developed and tested as an anti-angiogenic treatment for various solid tumors. More recently, IV-Bevacizumab was shown in a small, randomized controlled trial (n=14) to be very effective in treatment of refractory radiation necrosis after radiation therapy in brain tumors1. Patients received 7.5 mg/kg IV-Bevacizumab every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. All patients receiving Bevacizumab and none of the patients receiving placebo had significant clinical and radiographic improvement. This improvement was durable at 10 months in 8 of 11 patients (4 patients crossed over from the control group). There was however, a very high rate of adverse events (60%), and major adverse events (30%). Major adverse events included venous sinus thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, and aspiration pneumonia.

The investigators of the present study recently published a case series of two pediatric patients with highly symptomatic steroid refractory radiation necrosis in the brain after stereotactic radiosurgery for treatment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations3. Both patients were refractory to all accepted medical therapies. Both were steroid dependent for a prolonged period and severely cushingoid. Both had suffered a significant decline in quality of life with severe headache and needed to withdraw from school. In both instances, the patients made a remarkable progressive clinical and radiographic improvement after receiving a single 2.5 mg/kg dose of intra-arterial bevacizumab, which was durable one-year later. To increase bevacizumab penetration into the brain, the investigators used intra-arterial Mannitol to disrupt the blood-brain barrier immediately prior to targeted intra-arterial drug administration.

RATIONALE:

RATIONALE: CURRENT IV BEVACIZUMAB REGIMEN FOR RADIATION NECROSIS AND ITS ASSOCIATED MORBIDITY:

Current IV-bevacizumab regimens use a dose of 7.5 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. There are significant known side effects of bevacizumab including gastrointestinal perforation, deep venous thrombosis, venous sinus thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, intracranial hemorrhage, wound dehiscence, and severe hypertension. These complications are common to the anti-angiogenic class of drugs and reflect systemic exposure to bevacizumab. In our initial clinical experience, the investigators utilized a combination of intra-arterial (IA) route of delivery and BBB disruption to reduce bevacizumab dose while maintaining efficacy. This is supported by the durable clinical and radiographic response in our patients after a single 2.5 mg/kg dose of bevacizumab. The investigators believed that this approach would reduce the incidence of serious systemic toxicities compared to the IV-bevacizumab regimens (7.5-15 mg/kg every 2-3 weeks for several weeks to months).

There are multiple recent reports of patients with radiation necrosis who improved with IV-bevacizumab, only to relapse months later. In fact 3/11 patients in the randomized controlled trial discussed above required repeat treatment with IV-bevacizumab because of RN symptom progression1. In contrast, the two patients in our series who received IA-bevacizumab continue to show progressive clinical and radiographic improvement more than one year later. The investigators believe that the increased penetration of bevacizumab into the brain because of the intra-arterial administration after blood-brain barrier disruption results in binding of virtually all VEGF molecules. The fact that the results are durable and progressively improving suggests that massive blocking of VEGF activity could have stopped a positive feedback loop of inflammation. Therefore, IA-bevacizumab may result in more effective and durable control of radiation necrosis compared to traditional IV-bevacizumab treatment.

RATIONALE: INTRA-ARTERIAL (IA) ROUTE OF BEVACIZUMAB ADMINISTRATION SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES DRUG DELIVERY TO THE BRAIN:

IA-therapy decreases volume dilution of the drug in the circulation and reduces first-pass degradation via proteolytic catabolism, resulting in higher drug delivery to target brain tissue. Super-selective IA-injection of 99mTc-HMPAO (Ceretec®) into human cerebral arteries achieves a concentration of radiotracer in brain tissue 50 times higher than with IV injection. In clinical studies of cerebral chemotherapy, the concentration delivered to the tumor by using intra-arterial injection versus intravenous administration of chemotherapeutic agents was five times higher with hydrosoluble drugs and up to 50 times higher with liposoluble drugs. The investigators will infuse bevacizumab in the artery that supplies the territory affected by RN, such as cervical internal carotid artery and/or cervical vertebral artery.

RATIONALE: BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER BREAKDOWN PRIOR TO INTRA-ARTERIAL THERAPY FURTHER ENHANCES DRUG DELIVERY TO THE BRAIN:

The blood-brain-barrier is a selective permeability barrier that block entry of many drugs into the brain. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody with a high molecular weight (149 kDa). There is convincing evidence in the literature that the concentration in the brain of high molecular weight molecules can be significantly increased after osmotic BBB disruption. Several tumor clinical trials have shown that localization of monoclonal antibodies to the brain is poor without BBB disruption (0.0006%-0.0043% of the injected dose/g of tumor). There is also evidence of a 20-fold increase in permeability to immunoreactive IgM Mab with BBB disruption in rats. The investigators believe that using blood-brain-barrier disruption significantly increases delivery of Bevacizumab to the affected brain. The investigators will use the protocol described by Neuwelt and colleagues, using infusion of 25% Mannitol over 30 seconds. This protocol has been shown to temporarily disrupt the blood brain barrier, peaking at 15 minutes and dissipating in 4 hours. IA-chemotherapy following BBBD has been shown to be feasible and safe across multiple centers with low incidence of complications27. The efficacy and safety profile was reproducible across multiple centers. In fact, safety of this protocol has been established in more than 6000 patients treated worldwide with BBBD for intra-arterial chemotherapy infusion. The main possible complication is seizure, which occurs in \<6% of cases. It is important to note that these seizures generally occurred in patients with widespread malignant pathology such as Glioblastoma and CNS lymphoma who were treated with very toxic chemotherapy agents immediately after BBBD. Recent refinements to the osmotic BBBD protocol have incorporated the use of general anesthesia, as well as prophylaxis with an anti-epileptic agent and Valium to reduce seizure threshold and the chance of seizures.

SAFETY OF CEREBRAL INTRA-ARTERIAL BEVACIZUMAB TREATMENT:

Safety of IA-Bevacizumab treatment after hyperosmotic BBBD was recently established in a series of malignant glioma patients. This was done through super-selective injection of intracranial tumor arterial pedicles for purpose of anti-tumor effects. Dose-escalation was performed from 2 mg/kg to 15 mg/kg without reaching maximal tolerated dose. There was a significant decrease in the contrast enhancing and FLAIR signal characteristics of the tumor and surrounding brain at one month after treatment. Overall toxicity for this cohort was comparable to previous reports for IV Bevacizumab therapy. Specifically, hyperosmotic BBB-breakdown followed by IA-Bevacizumab administration did not cause any direct neurotoxicity; there were no cases of intracranial hemorrhage. Multiple other reports of BBBD followed by intra-arterial bevacizumab treatment for other pathologies such as vestibular schwannoma, ependymoma, and malignant brainstem glioma have also demonstrated good safety profile with no obvious neurotoxicity.

TREATMENT PLAN:

VASCULAR ACCESS, CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM, AND OSMOTIC BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER DISRUPTION:

The investigators will use the protocol described by Neuwelt and colleagues, using infusion of 25% Mannitol over 30 seconds. The safety of this protocol has been established in more than 6000 patients treated worldwide with BBBD for intra-arterial chemotherapy infusion.

The patients are to be premedicated with 6 mg Dexamethasone and 1000 mg Keppra. General endotracheal anesthesia will be induced. The femoral artery will be accessed using the Seldinger technique. A 5-French diagnostic catheter will be used to catheterize the cervical internal carotid artery ipsilateral to the area of radiation necrosis. Baseline internal carotid angiogram will be performed.

The anesthesiologist will be instructed to maintain SBP \>120 or at pre-operative baseline, whichever value is higher. This is important for efficient bulk flow of drug through the blood brain barrier opening. The catheter is positioned at C1-2 level in the cervical internal carotid artery and C6-7 for a vertebral artery infusion. Optimal rate of Mannitol infusion will be determined by performing injection of contrast at 4 ml/sec for 3 seconds into vessel. If there is no reflux of contrast into the external carotid artery, the injection rate injection will be increased by 2 ml/sec to maximum of 12 ml/sec. The lowest rate at which there is reflux into the external carotid artery will be chosen (the rate to just exceed cerebral blood flow.

Next, 5 mg IV Valium and 0.2 mg IV Atropine are to be administered. Warm (37 degrees Co) 25% Mannitol is filtered through a 5-micron filter, and then infused into the ipsilateral cervical carotid artery at the rate determined above for a total of 30 seconds.

INTRA-ARTERIAL BEVACIZUMAB ADMINISTRATION:

Test injection of contrast will be done in the artery. If there is any evidence of catheter-induced vasospasm, the catheter may be withdrawn more proximally within the artery. Repeat test injection of contrast will be done to document resolution of vasospasm. Within 5 minutes of Mannitol infusion, 2.5 mg/kg bevacizumab in a volume of 100 ml will be administered into the artery over 10 minutes. Repeat angiogram will be performed to document BBBD, as well as to rule out thromboembolic phenomenon.","INTERVENTIONAL","NA","SINGLE_GROUP","TREATMENT",NA,NA,NA,"NONE",NA,10,"ACTUAL","Inclusion Criteria:

RP is associated with significant morbidity that may include loss of the digits due to repeated episodes of vasospasm of the digital arteries in addition to significant impairment of quality of life. It is well known that cold exposure precipitates episodes of RP, but the mechanism for cold sensitivity is not known, and treatment of RP is not satisfactory to the patients and their physicians.

The goal in this study is to test the possibility that non invasive vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS) with gammaCore which is already approved by the FDA for headaches and migraines may be an effective and well tolerated therapy for Raynaud's Phenomenon.","Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) is a common vascular disorder that that affects approximately 10% of the general population. RP causes some areas of the body (i.e. fingers and toes) to feel cold and numb in response to cold exposure or emotional stress. Raynaud's phenomenon is characterized by reversible vasospasm of the fingers and toes. This reversible narrowing of the small arteries induces episodes of color changes of the fingers and toes. During an attack of Raynaud's, affected areas of the skin usually first turn white, then they often turn blue and feel cold and numb (pins and needles). As the fingers warm and circulation improves the affected areas may turn red, throb and tingle.

Moreover, Raynaud's phenomenon can be associated with significant morbidity that may include ulceration of fingers and loss of the fingers and toes due to repeated episodes of reversible narrowing of arteries supplying blood to the finger and toes. It is well known that cold exposure leads to episodes of RP, but the mechanism for cold sensitivity is not known, and treatment of RP is not satisfactory to the patients and their physicians.

Raynaud's phenomenon is classified as Primary Raynaud's phenomenon (PRP) in the absence of other vascular or connective tissue disease. Raynaud's phenomenon is classified as Secondary Raynaud's phenomenon (SRP) if it is associated with connective tissue disease, like systemic sclerosis (SSc, Scleroderma).

Treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon is not satisfactory in general, as current therapy employing calcium channel blockers and other vasodilators are frequently ineffective or not well tolerated, due to significant side effects.

Noninvasive vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS) is currently FDA approved for therapeutic uses in patient ages 12 and above to treat cluster and migraine headaches. Recent studies have shown that vagal nerve stimulation has vasodilatory and anti-inflammatory properties which has led to more preclinical research examining vagus nerve stimulation as treatment for a wider range of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. Vagus nerve stimulation has shown promising results in treating chronic inflammatory disorders such as sepsis, lung injury, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetes. Although there are no direct data to demonstrate vagus nerve stimulation's effect in Raynaud's phenomenon, the investigators believe that VNS's success in treating headache and migraine attacks indirectly support its use in Raynaud's phenomenon by its direct effect on vasospasms (narrowing of blood vessels). In fact migraine has been found as a risk factor for the development of Raynaud's phenomenon further supports this notion.

GammaCore is a safe and effective non-drug treatment approved for treating cluster and migraine headaches. It is a patented device that activates the vagus nerve with gentle electrical stimulation. The vagus nerve is an important highway of communication between the brain and many parts of the body, it plays an important role in regulating pain. Noninvasive vagus nerve stimulation with GammaCore is believed to help block the pain signals that cause migraines and cluster headaches. Unlike traditional vagus nerve stimulation therapies, gammaGore stimulates the vagus nerve through the skin at the side of the neck without the need for surgery. This non-invasive method avoids many side effects and inconveniences associated with injectable, inhaled or pill-based medication.

The investigators' goal is to test the possibility that noninvasive vagus nerve stimulation using gammaCore may be an effective and well tolerated therapy for Raynaud's phenomenon. The investigators aim to gain a fundamental understanding of the role of noninvasive vagus nerve stimulation as a potential therapy for Raynaud's phenomenon, a truly unmet medical need.","INTERVENTIONAL","RANDOMIZED","PARALLEL","TREATMENT","At randomization subjects are randomized to 2 groups, the Experimental group and the Sham group.

The treatment program is called Learn to live with migraine and goes by the abbreviation I AM (Internet Approach to Migraine). I AM is a complement to the medical treatment and focuses on pain management and learning to live as good a life as possible with the disease migraine. During the spring of 2022, I AM has been tested regarding the feasibility of primary care on 29 research subjects in a pilot RCT (DNR 2020-02359). A weighted preliminary assessment shows moderate effect size on mental health, that the participants accept the intervention, and that I AM with recruitment and care process can be carried out in a primary care context. Purpose: An overall purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of the addition of the internet-based biopsychosocial treatment I AM compared to usual treatment (TREATMENT as usual - TAU) in primary care regarding frequency and severity of migraine attacks, functional level, mental health, quality of life and employment rate with a randomized controlled trial design (RCT). An additional aim is to evaluate whether it is possible to prevent episodic migraine from developing into chronic migraine among those who have episodic migraine at the start of the study via the supplement treatment program I AM. Expected results: The greatest expected benefit of I AM is to reduce the burden and suffering of migraines for all the people affected. AM is also expected to increase the availability of treatment with a biopsychosocial perspective, have a quality-enhancing effect in terms of method and increase the patient's participation in their treatment. An environmental aspect is that neither patient nor therapist need to travel, accessibility also increases for individuals living in smaller communities who receive equal treatment.","An overall purpose of the study is to evaluate in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) the effect of the addition of the internet-based treatment Internet Approach to Migraine (I AM ) compared to usual treatment (Treatment as usual - TAU) in primary care regarding frequency and severity of migraine attacks, functional level, mental health, quality of life and employment rate. An additional aim is to evaluate whether it is possible to prevent episodic migraine, among those who have episodic migraine at the start of the study, from developing into chronic migraine in primary care via the addition of the I AM treatment program for migraine, compared to TAU.

Question / Hypothesis Impact evaluation - primary outcomes1. What effect does I AM have, in comparison with treatment as usual (TAU) regarding the frequency and severity of migraine as well as functional capacity, mental health and quality of life, in follow-up measurement after termination, at 6 months after the end of treatment, and at 1 year and 2 years of follow-up measurement? The hypothesis is that there is an interaction effect and that the participants in I AM at follow-ups have a significantly lower degree of frequency and severity of migraine, as well as better functional ability, mental health and quality of life.2. Is there a significant difference between how many people have developed chronic migraine (measured by cut off of 15 days a month?) in the I AM and TAU groups, respectively? The hypothesis being tested is that the frequency and severity of migraine attacks is not reduced or further developed by the targeted treatment program I AM in comparison with TAU.

Process Evaluation - Secondary outcomes3. What effect does I AM have in comparison to TAU regarding flexibility and acceptance, selfcompassion, mindfulness, degree of pain sensitivitization and confidence in one's ability to engage in physical training?

Mondino"" Foundation","OTHER",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA,NA,"Migraine is a common, yet often disabling, neurological disease that affects over 1 billion people around the world. It's the second most disabling disease globally and the leading cause of disability for people under the age of 50, especially women. The effects of migraine aren't limited to the individual, with a tremendous economic impact on families, friends, and employers. To help reduce this burden, research is now focusing on developing biomarkers that can help with diagnosis, predicting response to treatments, and identifying those at risk of developing chronic migraine.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are one of the most promising classes, as they can modulate gene expression and affect a wide range of cellular processes. Other studies have already observed different miRNA expression in those with episodic migraine or chronic migraine, but no specific miRNAs have been identified as a strong and specific migraine signature. miRNA-155 is of particular interest, as it has been linked to inflammation and pain, and may be a potential target for migraine treatments.

It is known that the immune system plays a role in migraine headaches. Monocytes, a type of immune cell, may be involved in the development of migraines. Certain medicines, such as aspirin, can affect monocyte function and have been used to treat migraines. Recent research has also shown that microRNAs can regulate the activity of these cells and influence inflammation, which may be linked to migraine attacks.

This study aims to investigate the role of miRNA-155 and monocyte differentiation in migraine patients, and in particular its association with migraine phenotype and severity. We aim to study three groups of subjects: Episodic migraine (EM), Chronic migraine with or without Medication Overuse Headache (CM-MOH) and Healthy Controls (HCs).","Background:

Depending on the median frequency of headache, migraine is defined as episodic migraine (EM) (for those who have less than 15 migraine days per month), or chronic migraine (for those who have at least 15 headache days per month, 8 of which with migraine features, for at least three months). The chronification of migraine is often associated with a progressive increase of acute medications intake, leading to a condition known as Medication Overuse Headache (CM-MOH).

So far, there are no validated and reliable biomarkers of migraine, but the headache scientific community is intensely investigating the neurobiological signatures of migraine. Validated biological biomarkers may allow several steps forward in the management of migraine by: (I) refining the diagnosis according to biological features; (II) predicting the response to advanced therapies; (III) predicting which patients are at the greatest risk of migraine chronification and mark different phases of the migraine cycle; (IV) the identification of novel molecular targets for drugs development. Fulfilling these purposes, a class of molecules that has recently gained enormous interest are microRNAs (miRNAs). miRNAs are small endogenous noncoding RNAs that are around 22 nucleotides in length. miRNAs operate as post-transcriptional regulator of gene expression by promoting messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation or repressing mRNA translation. The regulation process performed by miRNAs is complex and articulated since an individual miRNA might target hundreds of different mRNAs, and conversely, each mRNA may be regulated by multiple miRNAs. It has been estimated that more than 60% of all protein-coding genes are regulated by miRNAs which consequentially determine the pleiotropic modulation of a wide variety of cellular processes involving differentiation, development and signaling. miRNAs are involved in the generation and maintenance of pain and several evidence suggest that specific miRNAs could play a role in migraine.

The micro-MIG study corroborated the hypothesis that different miRNAs expression is altered in EM and CM when compared to a control group, although no specific miRNAs were identified as a strong and specific migraine molecular signature.

miRNA-155 can be considered as a master regulator of inflammation since its expression can modulate many inflammatory stimuli such as: interleukin 1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), alarmins (eg, IL-1α), hypoxia, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2), pathogen-associated and damage-associated molecular patterns as well as to toll-like receptor ligand (TLR) in various cell types. Recently, several lines of preclinical evidence further highlighted the role of miRNA-155 in inflammation and pain generation and maintenance also as a feasible therapeutic target. The inhibition of miRNA-155 can alleviate hyperalgesia and bone cancer pain as well as neuropathic pain in in-vivo rodent models. Therefore, it can be inferred that miRNA-155 might also play an important role in neurogenic inflammation, a process supposed to take place in the trigeminovascular system, and related to the pathogenic mechanisms underlying migraine pain.

Monocytes are immune system components which may play a role in migraine. For example, abortive migraine treatment may influence monocyte function. Acetylsalicylic acid inhibits monocyte chemotaxis, whereas metoprolol, metoclopramide, dihydroergotamine, and sumatriptan have no impact. microRNAs have been shown to regulate macrophage polarization and subsequent effects on inflammation.

Aims:

In order to shed light upon the mediators involved in migraine pathophysiology and its chronification, we aim to asses the different expression of miRNA-155 (in monocytes) in patients with EM, CM-MOH and healthy controls (HCs). Secondly, we aim to provide information about distribution of monocyte phenotype in the three groups.

Expected evaluations:

For all patients is scheduled a single evaluation over time - baseline (T0) - in the interictal migraine phase, during which they will undergo:

* informed consent signing
* screening visit
* clinical and demographic data collection (based on revision of a headache diary)
* venous blood sampling All patients will be evaluated in the morning, after night fasting, and in the inter-ictal migraine phase.

Detailed description of the methods planned for the biochemical analyses could be found here:

* 10.1186/s10194-020-01189-0;
* 10.1177/0333102420949201.

Sample size calculation:

Sample size was calculated from preliminary data available, which showed a difference in miR-155 levels in peripheral mononuclear cells of 1.69 RQ (relative quantification), with standard deviations of 1.15, and 2.69 RQ in healthy control and episodic migraine subjects, respectively. This difference has been assumed the same between episodic and chronic subjects.

Therefore, assuming a statistical power of 80 percent, a significance level of 95 percent and performing Bonferroni correction, we need a sample size of 24 subjects for the three experimental groups (HCs, CM-MOH and EM). Considering possible variability in dosing, we will enroll at least 30 subjects per group.

Pre-planned statistical analysis:

The difference between of miR155 expression among CM-MOH, EM and HCs will be determined by parametric (ANOVA) or non-parametric (Kruskal-Wallis) tests depending on the distribution of data. Parametric or non-parametric correlations will be used to measure the relationship between biochemical variables and clinical variables in CM-MOH and EM patients. Multivariate analyses will be performed according to the results of the univariate analysis. Statistical significance will be set at the 5% level (p\<0.05).","OBSERVATIONAL",NA,NA,NA,NA,"CASE_CONTROL","CROSS_SECTIONAL",NA,NA,90,"ESTIMATED","Healthy Controls:

Intercranial vasculature containing nociceptor innervation consists of unmyelinated (c-fibers) and thinly myelinated (a-delta fibers ) axons which hold vasoactive neuropeptides including substance P and (CGRP) calcitonin gene related peptide. When a migraine occurs, there is a cortical spreading depolarization, which on a molecular level involves a release of ATP, glutamate, potassium, hydrogen ions, glia or vascular cells, and CGRP and nitric oxide by activated perivascular nerves. These substances, including CGRP diffuse to come in contact with nociceptors causing neurogenic inflammation (vasodilation), thus propagating a headache.

Electrical perineural dry needling causes the release of substance-P and CGRG predominantly from non-neural structures, facilitating a negative feedback loop to neural and neuroactive components of the target tissue. This causes a lowering of the levels of CGRP which in turn decreases the inflammatory component thought to play a role in migraine headaches.","INTERVENTIONAL","RANDOMIZED","CROSSOVER","TREATMENT","Randomized controlled cross-over study",NA,NA,"DOUBLE","The participant will be masked to which treatment arm they are in.

The enrollment and application training may occur in two separate visits instead of one.

First visit - The first visit will include screening, enrollment and training on the application.

Enrollment: The screening process will include an eligibility assessment and a urine pregnancy test. Following successful screening, the site staff will provide the participants with study related information, perform an enrollment interview and receive an informed consent from the participants. During this visit, participants will complete baseline questionnaires that included information on the frequency and severity of their migraine attacks, typical associated symptoms, use of preventive and acute treatments, and the effect that their migraine attacks have on their daily routine and quality of life.

Application training: Eligible participants who enroll to the study will be trained to use the diary mode of the application that is installed on their own smartphones. The participants will be instructed to report the onset of all their migraines and headaches and complete a migraine diary questions regarding their pain intensity levels, the presence/absence of aura and associated migraine symptoms (nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, and allodynia) as well as rate their stress level and functional disability at baseline, 2- and 24-hours post-treatment.

Run-in phase: After the enrollment visit, participants will undergo a 4-week migraine diary phase aimed to collect baseline migraine characteristics and further assess eligibility. The participants will use the app to record pain intensity levels, the presence/absence of aura and associated migraine symptoms (nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, and allodynia) as well as the effect that their migraine attacks have on their daily routine and quality of life, at baseline, 2- and 24-hours post-treatment. These reports will be transferred by the application to the electronic data capture (EDC) system, where they will be collected and registered.

Participants who report at least 6 qualifying migraine headaches with pain data at baseline and 2 hours post-treatment will continue to the treatment phase.

Second visit- Device training: Eligible participants who successfully complete the run-in phase will receive the Nerivio™ device. The device will be registered and connected by Bluetooth to their smartphone. During this visit, participants will be trained to use the device. Device training will include finding the optimal individual stimulation intensity level (perceptible but not painful), that will be subject to change during the treatment phase. The site staff will also carefully review with the patient how to identify a qualifying migraine headache (see below) and provide detailed instructions on study procedures.

If the research staff recognizes that the participant cannot tolerate the feeling of the electrical stimulation, the participant may be withdrawn from the study.

* Treatments of migraine and headaches with Nerivio™ should be performed as soon as possible after migraine headache or aura began and always within one hour of symptoms onset. Treatments of mild headaches are accepted.
* Avoid taking rescue medications within two hours post-treatment (2 hours from start of treatment), if possible.
* The treatment should be performed for at least 30 minutes (the recommended treatment duration is 45 minutes).

The site personnel will be required to document the training session in the CRF.

Treatment phase: Participants will be instructed to use the device for the treatment of migraine and/or headaches (see below) as soon as possible and always within 60 minutes of onset during a period of up to 4 weeks. Participants will be instructed to use the device with the intensity level identified during the device training visit (and adjust as necessary) and make sure the stimulation is perceptible but not painful. Participants will be instructed to avoid taking rescue medications within 2 hours post-treatment. If medications are used, participants will be instructed to record in the app when and which medication was taken at 2- and 24-hours post treatment. The participants will use the app to record pain intensity levels, the presence/absence of aura and associated migraine symptoms (nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, and allodynia) as well as the effect that their migraine attacks have on their daily routine and quality of life, at baseline, 2- and 24-hours post-treatment. At the beginning of each treatment, participants will also be asked to report the time elapsed from attack onset. Adverse events will be reported throughout this phase of the study directly to the site staff.

Participants who do not achieve satisfactory relief at 2 hours post-treatment may treat again with the Nerivio™ device or may treat with usual care at that time or any time thereafter if the headache does not resolve. Participants will also be able to treat headache recurrence with the device. Migraine headaches that are not treated with the device may be treated with usual care.

The first reported treatment will be considered a ""training"" treatment, aimed to verify that the participants use the device properly, and will only be included in the safety analysis. The efficacy evaluation will be performed on the first treatment of a qualifying attack (see below) following the training treatment (hereby termed ""test treatment"").

Third visit- Follow-up phase:

Following the 4-week period of the treatment phase, participants will return to the clinic to fill questionnaires assessing satisfaction and user experience. All participants who complete the treatment phase will enter an additional 8-week phase in which the device can be incorporate into their usual care. Participants will treat their migraines and headaches according to their preference- treatment with Nerivio only, treatment with medication only, both treatment options, or none. Participants will be asked to report all their migraine headaches at onset (migraines or headache), regardless if they are using the device or not. The participants will use the app to record pain intensity levels, the presence/absence of aura and associated migraine symptoms (nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, and allodynia) as well as the effect that their migraine attacks have on their daily routine and quality of life, at baseline, 2- and 24-hours post-treatment.

Fourth (final) visit - End of study:

Participants will return to the clinic following the end of the follow-up phase, at which time they will return the device. The participants will have the option of returning the device by mail instead of an on-site visit. Participants may be asked to fill additional questionnaires on their migraine and their experience with the device.","INTERVENTIONAL","NA","SINGLE_GROUP","TREATMENT",NA,NA,NA,"NONE",NA,126,"ACTUAL","Inclusion Criteria:

It is our hypothesis that the combined antiemetic and analgesic effects of metoclopramide (which has been study-proven to be effective in relieving symptoms of migraine headache) will prove to be more efficacious in relieving symptoms of acute mountain sickness than the standard, previously-studied analgesic medication, ibuprofen.","Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) is a well described disease process that occurs as a result of rapid exposure to high altitude. High altitude headache (HAH) is defined as the presence of headache in the setting of a recent increase in altitude. When HAH is associated with nausea, vomiting, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, lightheadedness or poor sleeping, AMS is diagnosed. While benign, AMS is very common, afflicting up to 80 % of travelers who ascend rapidly to 14,000 ft, and can be debilitating. AMS is thought to occur secondary to hypoxia-induced cerebral vasodilation. The antiemetic metoclopramide has been well studied and is commonly administered for treatment of migraine headaches in emergency departments across the U.S. The symptoms of migraine headaches are often similar to those of AMS. The mechanism of metoclopramide""s beneficial effect in this indication appear to be a result of its antagonism of central and peripheral dopamine receptors,most notably by blocking stimulation of the medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone. No studies have yet evaluated the potential benefits of metoclopramide for the relief of AMS. In contrast, ibuprofen has been well studied and found to be an effective treatment for the relief of symptoms of high altitude headache and AMS.

The study will be a convenience sample of trekkers traveling through the Annapurna Circuit in Nepal during the 3 month time period of March-May, 2012. Subjects will be recruited from visitors to Manang, Nepal staying in local hostels, those visiting the Himalayan Rescue Association clinic in Manang, and those responding to locally posted signage regarding study enrollment.

Eligible patients will be consented and enrolled in the study. Patients will be randomized to receive either Ibuprofen 400mg or Metoclopramide 10mg by mouth.

This randomised trial aims at evaluating the efficacy of osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) in supporting the management of NBD. The research will be conducted at the outpatient service of Neuro-Urology / Spinal Unit of the Città della Salute e della Scienza Hospital of Torino.

A sample of 62 participants will be divided into two groups: standard (nursing intervention) and experimental (nursing intervention and OMT). A neuro-urologist will determine the eligibility for the study.

Study design Randomised controlled trial. Participants recruited will be divided into two groups. The treatment group will receive five osteopathic manipulative treatment sessions in addition to the standard treatment.

The control group will only receive standard treatment.

Sample A neuro-urologist will determine eligibility for the study during an interview. Participants will be conducted during outpatient visits to the Neuro Urology department. This study does not include any diagnostic assessment or treatment, which are different from the normal patient's evaluation and management process.

Informed consent will be obtained before any evaluation or treatment. Principal Investigator will explain in detail the study purpose and procedures, risks and potential benefits. Participants will be provided with contact information and have adequate time to consider their participation in the study and encouraged to ask questions, both during the initial interview and throughout the study.

Staff involved in the study Operative Unit Staff (1 urologist specialist, 1 nursing coordinator, 2 nurses); Osteopaths of the School of Osteopathy of Milan (SOMA) who administer osteopathic manipulative treatment; Researcher performing randomisation and data analysis.

Interventions

Eligible participants will be randomised in two different treatment groups:

Conventional therapy (control group)

The conventional treatment consists of education provided by qualified nurses through an individual interview of 45-60 minutes structured as follows:

assessment of the best personal evacuation strategy concerning the quality of life, resources, and level of autonomy; evaluation of the correct execution of the identified evacuation manoeuvre (digital stimulation, manual removal, reflex stimulation, transanal irrigation, use of micro-enemas or suppositories; identification of the best postural strategies during an evacuation; nutrition and proper hydration education; education in completing the evacuation diary; bowel massage training; verification of the correct hiring of any previously prescribed laxative drugs. Approximately two months later, patients will be contacted by telephone to assess the effectiveness of the strategies used to carry out any telephone nursing counselling.

Osteopathic manipulative treatment (experimental group)

In addition to the conventional treatment described above, the experimental group will receive osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT).

The treatment will last 45 - 60 minutes with the following frequency: the subjects will receive three OMT every week, the two following twice weekly. The osteopathic treatment protocol will, therefore, last seven weeks. Each patient will be taken in charge by two operators during the entire duration of the study.

OMT procedures will be provided by a team of osteopaths, who will practice through specific training to improve palpation reliability before enrollment. The diagnostic and treatment procedures will follow a specific protocol, developed from clinical experience and evidence to improve treatment specificity, safety and reproducibility.

Osteopathic assessment General assessment: the presence of asymmetries, scars. The observation can provide a lot of information on the fascial structure; Assessment of the dural system: cranial and sacral grip, evaluating its intrinsic motility;

Assessment of the fascial system:

lower extremity intrarotation tests and upper limb flexion tests, assesses their quality and amount of movement and any restrictions; abdominal palpation, fascial entrainment in the abdominal-pelvic region; thoracic palpation, fascial entrainment in thoraco-abdominal area.

Assessment of the biomechanical system:

Diaphragms: pelvic, respiratory, upper thoracic, cranial; Structural palpation, spring test: iliac crests, hip mobility, ribs, glenohumeral / clavicles, supine vertebral test.

Each level of assessment (fascial, dural or biomechanical) in which dysfunction is highlighted will be correlated with all other systems and with autonomous nervous system. In relation to the dysfunctions found in the various systems, using parameters such as alterations of tissue density, asymmetry, rigidity (or reduction of range of motion) and tenderness (TART), treatment procedures will be implemented in the specific subject areas at somatic dysfunction.

Osteopathic treatment

Dural system:

L5-S1 decompression; sacred decompression among the iliacs; occipital-sphenoid approach; decongestion of occipital condyles

Fascial system:

fascial techniques in the abdominal region: right hypochondrium, epigastrium, left hypochondrium, right side, mesogastrium, left side, right iliac area, hypogastrium, left iliac area; relationship with corresponding vertebral levels (e.g. hypogastrium); fibro scar adhesions treatment.","INTERVENTIONAL","RANDOMIZED","PARALLEL","TREATMENT","Randomised controlled trial.

The pathophysiology of pain-related TMD is poorly understood. However, multiple risk factors have been identified, such as, gender, pain during jaw function and palpation, oral parafunctions, other pain conditions, pain sensitivity and psychosocial characteristics. Because of its multifactorial nature, a multimodal conservative treatment approach is recommended, including patient education, behavioral management, physical therapy, pharmacotherapy, and occlusal splints.

Among the pain-related TMD conditions are ""Headaches Attributed to TMD"". This diagnosis has replaced ""Headaches or facial pain attributed to Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ) disorder"" described in the International Classification of Headache Disorders II (ICHD-2). It is characterized by pain in the temple area secondary to pain-related TMD that is modified by function and parafunction affected by jaw movement, function, or parafunction.

In general, headache treatment is either abortive or prophylactic. Abortive treatment manages acute headache and prophylactic treatment aims to reduce the frequency and severity of the attacks. Intramuscular injections with Botulinum Toxin (BTX) are used in the prophylactic treatment of migraine and tension type headaches. The mechanisms by which the analgesic effects of BTX are mediated are not fully understood. One mechanism is the inhibition of neurogenic inflammation by blocking neurotransmitter release from sensitized nociceptors, thus reducing peripheral sensitization. In vitro, BTX has been found to inhibit Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP), and BTX reduces the vascular response to algogenic substances such as capsaicin applied to human skin. Other potential analgesic mechanisms include retrograde transport of BTX by sensory neurons and inhibition of neurotransmitter release by their central terminals.

In recent years, BTX has also been used in the treatment of myogenous-TMD with mixed results. Two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showed therapeutic benefits of BTX in the management of myogenous -TMD, while another 3 RCTs reported no significant effect of BTX in chronic myogenous -TMD pain. Varying patient samples, methodologies, and sample sizes may explain the differences. Additionally, the results have been compromised by poor methodologies, such as insufficiently powered clinical trials, and open-labeled studies. More recently, a systematic review of randomized controlled trials concluded that no consensus could be reached on the therapeutic benefit of BTX on TMD. More so, no trial on the effectiveness of BTX on the prophylactic treatment of headaches attributed to TMD has been reported to date.

The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of Botulinum toxin - A in the management of headaches attributed to TMD.

Study Design The study will be carried out in the clinics of TMD and Orofacial Pain, School of Dental Medicine, University at Buffalo. A prospective open label design will be used to assess the effectiveness of BTX in the management of Headaches Attributed to TMD.

The aim of treatment in the emergency service is to achieve a minimum level of undesirable side effects and to quickly relieve the pain which will not repeat after discharge from the emergency service. Ideal drug treatment contraindication should be at a minimum level and not trigger migraine. Paracetamol and Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are often used in the treatment of migraine headache.

Although narcotic analgesics provide effective and rapid analgesia, they have such side effects as hypotension, nausea and vomiting, drowsiness. In recent years, with the production of parenteral forms of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory painkillers, the analgesic efficacy of these drugs has been one of the topics of interest to researchers. Especially intravenous form of paracetamol is new yet compared to other Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and it is a drug with a wide safety margin and less incidence of side effects. The effectiveness of the Intravenous form of paracetamol and whether it can be an alternative to other analgesics is one of the major research topics today, and more study is needed on this subject.

Both drugs are often used in emergency services to treat headache caused by acute migraine attack. Our aim is to compare the effectiveness of intravenous dexketoprofen with paracetamol in the treatment of the headache caused by acute migraine attack.","Materials and Methods of Research:

Among the patients consulting the emergency service with a complaint of headache, those who meet the criteria of 'International Classification of Headache Disorders criteria for migraine without aura' and agreed to participate in the study will form the study group.

The patients forming the study group will be included in the study after they are evaluated according to the criteria of inclusion or exclusion. Our research is an equivalence study. Provided that the difference between the groups is 50 %, α: 99 %, and 1-β: 80 %, it has been determined that each group should include at least 94 subjects, and the number of voluntary subjects has been determined as 200, each group containing 100 subjects.

First of all, in the measurement of the frequency of headaches, the standard 11-point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), whose reliability is proven, and 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) will be used. For NRS, patients will be asked to score their pain on a scale ranging from 0 to 10, scoring 0 (zero) in the absence of pain, and 10 in the case of most severe pain; whereas, for VAS, they will be asked to score their pain on a scale ranging from 0 to 100, scoring 0 in the absence of pain, and 100 in the case of most severe pain. Verbal rating scale (VRS) with 4 standard points will be used as another measurement tool. In this measurement, patients will be asked to express their pain as severe, moderate, mild and no pain.

The patients will be divided to two groups.

Groups and drug doses to be given;

1. group: Dexketoprofen Trometamol (50 mg)
2. group: Paracetamol (1000 mg)

The drug which will be given after randomization will be diluted in 150 ml serum physiologic and will be given as intravenous rapid infusion.

The pains of the patients will be assessed in 0., 15. and 30. minutes by NRS, VAS and VRS, and they will be monitored for vital signs and possible side effects.

In 30. minute, the study will be ended, and If the pain continues, fentanyl 1 mcg / kg will be given.

When a patient eligible for the study consults, after obtaining the patient's written consent, the patient will be assigned to one of the study groups based on the next study number. Randomization of study numbers will be prepared by someone other than a person working in the emergency service with the help of a computer, and until the completion of the study, which number is assigned to which drug will be known only by that person. One of the nurses working in the emergency department will be responsible for preparing the study drug, while the other nurse blindly will be responsible for giving the study drug. The numbers belong to the previously enumerated study groups will be stored in envelopes which do not show the inside (allocation concealment), and the study drug will be prepared after the next envelope is opened by the study nurse.

Recently, the term Nociplastic Pain (NP) has been introduced as a third descriptor of mechanisms related to CP. NP describes conditions that arise from altered nociception despite no clear evidence of actual or threatened tissue damage. It represents a new way of describing somatoform painful conditions, originating from altered central-nervous pathways (e.g., central sensitization) and with the important involvement of clinical psychological factors. Among nociplastic chronic syndromes have been included fibromyalgia (FM), chronic migraine (CM) and vulvodynia (VU). These chronic pain disorders have been usually studied separately, although the high comorbidity rates. Many studies evidenced the role of psychosocial variables in the onset and maintenance of the burden related to these conditions. Among them, personality traits, defense mechanisms, central sensitization, and childhood traumatic experiences may play a pivotal role in the onset of the NP. The first aim of this study is to highlight possible psychosocial clusters of variables that are specific for each condition (FM, CM, and VU). A second aim, to improve the tailored psychological treatment devoted to these conditions, is to explore the association between FM, CM, and VU with depression, anxiety, somatization, quality of life, alexithymia, social support, sexual satisfaction, and functioning. This will make it possible to identify specifically for each condition the areas of greatest interest that can be investigated and treated in clinical intervention. To identify specific descriptors, NP conditions will be compared with a control group of subjects reporting other types of CP (e.g., knee arthrosis, rheumatoid arthritis). The study involves the collection of data from a self-administered questionnaire in several Italian centers specializing in the above-mentioned clinical conditions under the guidance of the research team of the Department of Dynamic and Clinical Psychology and Health Studies, PI Professor Federica Galli.","Chronic pain (CP), defined as pain lasting more than 3 months, is a substantial healthcare challenge. Prevalence rates of CP are between 11% and 40% (Dahlhamer et al., 2018; Fayaz et al., 2016). CP prevalence increases with age, is greater among females, and among people with lower socioeconomic status (Tsang et al., 2008; Pergolizzi et al., 2013). CP affects relationships and self-esteem, and is associated with higher divorce and suicide rates, and an increased risk of substance abuse (Tang et al., 2016; Fitzcharles et al., 2021), psychopathology (Katz et al., 2015) and risk of medication overuse (Westergaard et al., 2015). The causes of CP are still poorly understood. Recently, the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP, 2017) has proposed that three subtypes of CP may be differentiated based on unique causal mechanisms: nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic.

Nociplastic Pain (NP) is a new descriptor of CP and includes conditions that arise from altered nociception despite no clear evidence of actual or threatened tissue damage. NP should be viewed as an overarching term that can be applied to a diverse range of clinical conditions that share common neurophysiological mechanisms, involving various organ systems (Galli, 2023). Among nociplastic chronic syndromes have been included chronic migraine, fibromyalgia, and vulvodynia (Bergeron et al., 2020; Fitzcharles et al., 2021). NP is usually accompanied by other central nervous system-associated symptoms with a close link with clinical psychological factors: general symptoms (e.g., fatigue and cognitive problems), temperamental characteristics (e.g., hypersensitivity to environmental stimuli) and psychological symptoms (e.g., anxiety/depression) (Fitzcharles et al., 2021). Many emotional states, such as depression and anxiety, and emotional processes, such as emotional awareness and regulation, may influence the presence and severity of NP (Aaron et al., 2020; Lumley et al., 2021), opening to the importance of a psychological assessment for diagnosis and psychological interventions. The concept of NP opens a new framework for understanding the co-occurrence of different chronic disorders and the role of related psychological factors. Comorbid chronic disorders may be the expression of shared pathophysiological mechanisms, with etiological and psychological features differentiating them by ""pure"" forms of the same disease. The comorbid association of migraine, fibromyalgia, and vulvodynia, and the well-known link with clinical psychological factors (e.g., early traumatic events, anxiety and depression, alexithymia, dissociation, etc.) is quite established (Bergeron et al., 2020; Fitzcharles et al., 2021). However, these chronic pain disorders have been usually studied as separate diseases. On the one hand, this research project wants to observe the common basis of these chronic pain disorders, which can be traced back to central sensitization mechanisms, the influence of early adverse events, and other psychological factors, and on the other hand it wants to observe the psychosocial peculiarities of each assessed condition (fibromyalgia, migraine, and vulvodynia) for tailored treatment purposes.

CHRONIC MIGRAINE (CM) Migraine affects \~15% of the general population globally and is typically characterized by recurring, often highly disabling attacks of severe headache, nausea, vomiting, super- sensitivity to light and sound, and other variable physical, mental, and psychological signs and symptoms, lasting for 4-72 h (Ferrari et al., 2022). Migraine is listed by The Global Burden of Disease Study as the third most disabling disease worldwide (Vos et al., 2012). Most patients have episodic migraine, although some patients develop CM (the presence of ≥15 headache days per month). The 1- year prevalence of migraine is 8-15% worldwide, but is highly dependent on age, sex, and migraine subtype (Ferrari et al., 2015). Migraine is 40-60% determined by genetic factors and for the remainder by non- genetic risk- modulating and trigger factors. Although a progressive increase of the attack frequency can occur spontaneously, it is often aggravated and/or induced by overuse of acute headache medications and/or caffeine. Risk factors for migraine progression toward CM include high headache frequency, high headache-related disability, obesity, allodynia, anxiety, and depression (Ferrari et al., 2022). Comorbid migraine and anxiety/depression are common in the general population, but the mechanism(s) supporting the comorbidity are still unknown. Overall, there seems to be a bidirectional relationship between migraine and depression, and a shared pathophysiological mechanism has been recently outlined (Karsan \& Goadsby, 2021). Indeed, in cohort studies, the risk of incident migraine in persons with existing major depression was threefold higher than in persons without depression, and incident major depression in persons with pre- existing migraine was more than fivefold higher than in persons without migraine history (Modgill et al., 2011). Comorbid anxiety/depression increases the risk of migraine chronification (Guidetti et al., 1998; Tietjen et al., 2007). However, there is no evidence that treating depression or anxiety mitigates migraine (Ferrari et al., 2022). Other psychological factors have been linked to migraine over time, as the case of alexithymia (Galli et al., 2017, Bottiroli et al., 2018), traumatic events (Bottiroli et al., 2019; Stensland et al., 2013), early episodes of maltreatment (Tietjen et al., 2016), personality characteristics (Bottiroli et al., 2016; 2021; Galli et al., 2019).

FIBROMYALGIA (FM) FM is a chronic syndrome characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain associated with fatigue, nonrestorative sleep, and cognitive deficits (Wolfe et al., 2016) with high incidence among women (Branco et al., 2010). The prevalence of CP comorbidities among FM patients was also high ranging from 39% to 76% (with headache and irritable bowel syndrome that were the most prevalent). Although a central sensitization phenomenon seems to play a central role in FM (Arnold et al., 2016), the etiopathology of FM remains unknown (Thieme et al., 2017). For these reasons, researchers have proposed a biopsychosocial model of interacting variables that can activate and exacerbate FM symptoms (Sommer et al., 2012). FM patients experience excessive levels of psychological distress: 20-80% experience anxiety and 13-64% experience depression (Galvez-Sánchez et al., 2019). A recent systematic review on comorbidities in FM (Kleykamp et al., 2021) found that the most prevalent comorbidity across all studies reviewed was depression/major depressive disorder with over half of the patients included having this diagnosis in their lifetime. Another interesting personality construct involved in FM is 'distressed' personality (van Middendorp et al., 2016). Moreover, nearly one-third of FM patients had current or lifetime bipolar disorder, panic disorder, or post-traumatic stress disorder. Specifically, among environmental factors, stressful life events have been considered (Nakamura et al., 2014). Trauma and major life stress are unlikely to cause FM per se. In genetically susceptible persons, it is likely that early trauma and prolonged stress in adulthood will influence brain modulatory circuitry of both pain and emotions (Crofford, 2007; Schweinhardt et al., 2008) that could explain the increased pain responses and symptoms of patients with FM. Traumatic events have been shown to influence pain severity as well (Bote et al., 2013). Several theoretical models have suggested that some personality characteristics lead to a worse response to stressors and adjustment to diseases in people with CP, such as FM (Naylor et al., 2017; Galvez-Sánchez et al., 2019). A minority of studies have focused on the detection of personality disorders associated with FM (Attademo \& Bernardini, 2018). In general, previous studies found a high prevalence of avoidance (41.4%), obsessive-compulsive (33.1%) and borderline personality disorder (5.2-27.4%) in FM (Thieme et al., 2004; Uguz et al., 2010; Gumà-Uriel et al., 2016). In recent years, many studies on FM have reported a high prevalence of alexithymia (15-20%) (Di Tella et al., 2017; Marchi et al., 2019; Atzeni et al., 2019).

VULVODYNIA Vulvodynia is a condition that occurs in 8-10% of women of all ages (Arnold et al., 2007; Harlow et al., 2014) and is characterized by localized pain in the vulva, either spontaneous or upon touch, and can occur during sexual and/or non-sexual situations (Bergeron et al., 2020). Vulvodynia has a negative effect on the quality of life of women and their partners and imposes a profound personal and social economic burden. The diagnosis is established through a careful history and pelvic examination, including the cotton swab test, based on persistent vulvar pain lasting more than 3 months without an identifiable cause and with several potential associated factors. These include musculoskeletal and neurological factors, comorbid pain syndromes (such as fibromyalgia, chronic migraine, and irritable bowel syndrome) and psychosocial factors (Reed et al., 2012; Wesselmann et al., 2014; Bergeron et al., 2020). Current literature suggests that the onset and maintenance of vulvodynia likely involves a complex interplay of peripheral and central pain mechanisms, pelvic floor muscle and autonomic dysfunction, anxiety, depression, and adverse childhood events, as well as cognitive-affective, behavioral, and interpersonal factors (Bergeron et al., 2020). Vulvodynia has traditionally been conceptualized in a dualistic manner, arising from either physical factors or psychological and sexual difficulties, although research contrary to this concept and other hypotheses suggest that these two perspectives should be combined. Therefore, future studies should move in this direction, seeking to identify specific pathophysiological mechanisms within the framework of a biopsychosocial model. Indeed, a more recent theorization has focused on an integrated model that considers the interdependence of biopsychosocial factors in vulvodynia and associated disorders, in which medical and psychosocial mechanisms are considered to contribute to the onset, chronicization and exacerbation of pain and associated difficulties (Bergeron et al., 2011). The neurophysiology of vulvodynia is multifaceted. It is characterized by both peripheral and central sensory abnormalities (Wesselmann et al., 2014; Pukall et al., 2016). Furthermore, increased sensitivity to different sensory modalities at extragenital sites has been demonstrated in women with vulvodynia (Giesecke et al., 2004; Foster et al., 2005; Sutton et al., 2015), suggesting central sensitization. This central sensitization could explain the observation of overlapping chronic pain conditions in women with vulvodynia, which need further investigation to be better understood.

PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS ASSOCIATED TO NP As the investigators have already pointed out separately for the three pathological conditions (chronic migraine, fibromyalgia, and vulvodynia), there is evidence that factors such as personality traits, defense mechanisms, central sensitization, and childhood traumatic experiences may contribute significantly to the genesis of these disorders through a process of central sensitization of pain pathways. Central sensitization (CS) is defined as increased responsiveness of nociceptive neurons in the central nervous system to their normal or subthreshold afferent input according to the IASP - International Association for the Study of Pain (Arendt-Nielsen et al., 2018). A sensitized nervous system has been considered one of the most important mechanisms involved in NP (Cohen, 2022). CS plays a role in fibromyalgia, in which alteration of central nociceptive processing occurs and pain can be worsened by psychological factors (Sluka \& Clauw, 2016). In migraine, CS may contribute to acute allodynia and headache chronification (De Tommaso \& Sciruicchio, 2016). Furthermore, in migraine CS may play a role in trigeminal nerve activation and cortical spreading depression (De Tommaso \& Sciruicchio, 2016). It has been suggested that migraine may be considered as a brain state of altered excitability and a disorder of sensory processing (Goadsby et al., 2017), encompassing additional symptoms as fatigue and mood disorders (Karsan \& Goadsby, 2021). Structural and functional MRI studies in women with provoked vulvar or distant/extra- genital pain have supported a role of central sensitization and dysregulation of endogenous pain modulatory systems in the central nervous system in the pathophysiology of vulvodynia (Bergeron et al., 2020).

In the process of central sensitization, psychological factors such as traumatic events in childhood, the development of specific personality expressions (traits), and the use of different forms of defense mechanisms also play a role. No study to our knowledge has yet tried to identify specific clusters of psychological factors (personality traits, defense mechanisms, central sensitization, and childhood traumatic experiences) capable of characterizing or differentiating between the different pathologies expressed by a NP.

In addition to this, the study of psychosocial factors associated with the experience of such pathologies or possible emerging clusters such as depression, anxiety, somatization, quality of life, alexithymia, social support, sexual satisfaction, and functioning. This will make it possible to identify specifically for each condition the areas of greatest interest that can be investigated and treated in clinical intervention tailored to the person.

Aims To highlight possible psychosocial clusters of variables that are specific to the onset and maintenance for each condition (FM, CM, and VU). Specifically, the observation of possible clusters will be made based on variables such as personality traits, defense mechanisms, central sensitization, and childhood traumatic experiences. The hypothesis is that specific psychological factors (clusters of high number of early traumatic events, high levels of central sensitization, and specific traits and defense mechanisms) characterize FM, CM, and VU groups compared to controls.","OBSERVATIONAL",NA,NA,NA,NA,"COHORT","CROSS_SECTIONAL",NA,NA,432,"ESTIMATED","Inclusion criteria:

The migraine headache component may be present with associated light and sound sensitivity but the vestibular symptoms are usually prominent . Migraine prophylaxis has been shown to provide some benefit to help to prevent or abort acute attacks of vertigo .

Vestibular migraine has a life time prevalence of about 1 % and a 1-year prevalence of 0.9 % in the general population and accounts for about 7% of patients seen in dizziness clinics and 9 % of patients seen in migraine clinics .

The International Headache Society and the International Barany Society for Neuro-otology have developed a consensus document with diagnostic criteria for VM . This diagnosis was included in the appendix of the new international classification of headache disorders (ICHD)-3 beta version of headache classification .

Diagnostic criteria The criteria for VM combine the typical signs and symptoms of migraine with the exclusion criteria of other disorders that also elicit vestibular signs . As in migraine without aura, a diagnosis of VM mainly depends on the patient history, for so far there are no clinically useful biomarkers.

Vestibular migraine diagnostic criteria International Bárány Society for Neuro-Otology and the International Headache Society (2012):- A. At least five episodes fulfilling criteria C and D B. A current or past history of migraine without aura or migraine with aura C. Vestibular symptoms of moderate or severe intensity, lasting 5 min to 72 hours D.

Experimental studies have demonstrated that trigeminal and vestibular ganglion cells share neurochemical properties and express serotonin, capsaicin, and purinergic receptors. Nociceptive and vestibular afferents with neurochemical similarities converge in brainstem structures like the parabrachial nucleus, the raphe nuclei, and the locus coeruleus. All of these structures play an important role in modulating the sensitivity of pain pathways.

The pathogenesis of IBD involves immunological, genetic and environmental factors. Currently there is no cure for Crohn's disease and available medical and surgical treatments are expensive and often associated with significant side effects. Anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF-α) agents are widely used for treatment of Crohn's disease. Electrical neuromodulation is a new treatment approach of bioelectronic medicine, involving molecular medicine, neuroscience, and bioengineering. Multiple possible mechanisms have been proposed for electrical neuromodulation in GI diseases, including central, autonomic, and/or enteric mechanisms. Vagal tone is significantly blunted in IBD and is associated with high TNF- α levels. Animal and preliminary human studies have demonstrated that electrical vagal nerve stimulation (VNS), including non-invasive vagal stimulation (nVNS), exerts an anti-inflammatory effect by harnessing the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. In healthy humans nVNS has been shown to decrease tumor necrosis factor-α levels. Invasive VNS has been shown to improve inflammation in preliminary studies in patients with Crohn's disease.

Adult patients with active Crohn's disease will be asked to self-administer transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation three times per day for 16 weeks.

Mondino"" Foundation","OTHER",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,NA,"In 2021, the Italian Medicines Agency approved reimbursement of monoclonal antibodies targeting the CGRP pathway (CGRP-mAbs) as preventive therapies for patients with high frequency and chronic migraine (CM). A moderate to severe disability, quantified as a MIgraine Disability ASsessment (MIDAS) score \> or equal to 11, is required for prescription. Score reduction of at least 50% after the first three months (T3) is mandatory to continue treatment.

This is a prospective real-life, open-label study. CM patients will be treated with erenumab 70-140 mg subcutaneous injections every 28 days for one year (T13). We will record the following parameters: demographic and headache features, monthly migraine and headache days (MMDs and MHDs respectively), days and doses of symptomatic intake. Patients also completed questionnaires evaluating migraine related disability (MIDAS and HIT-6), psychological comorbidities (HADS-A and HADS-D), quality of life (MSQ and 0 to 100 visual analogue scale) and allodynia (ASC-12).

At least a 50% reduction in MIDAS score or MMDs after 3 months of treatment will be testedas predictors of long-term clinical outcome.","Monoclonal antibodies directed against the Calcitonin Gene Related Peptide (CGRP-mAbs) pathway are a silver lining in the setting of migraine therapies, partly overcoming the issues related to poor effectiveness and tolerability of previous preventive treatments.

These drugs act on the CGRP pathway, a key vasoactive neuropeptide in migraine pathophysiology involved in activation and sensitization of afferent trigeminal nociceptors of the trigeminovascular system. Galcanezumab, fremanezumab and eptinezumab target the CGRP ligand, while erenumab, a fully human IgG2, targets its receptor. mAbs efficacy and safety have been largely documented in multiple randomized clinical trials, open-label studies as well as in the real-world setting.

The Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) approved a 12-month period of mAbs treatment reimbursement through the National Health Service for migraine patients with the following features: i) at least 8 migraine days per month in the last three months, ii) a MIgraine Disability ASsessment (MIDAS) score ≥ 11, and iii) previous failure for inefficacy or no tolerability of at least three preventive drugs, among β-blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, antiepileptics, and onabotulinumtoxin-A for chronic migraine (CM).

In addition, a reduction of at least 50% of MIDAS score after 3 and 6 months of treatment is the only mandatory step to continue beyond these check-points. Thus, MIDAS score is pivotal for mAbs treatment initiation and continuation. MIDAS is a self-administered five-item questionnaire focusing on reduction in home and workplace productivity, and a score \> 11 identify a set of patients with a moderate to severe disability. A MIDAS score reduction during mAbs treatment was demonstrated in the short and long term period, but its role as predictor of mAbs clinical outcome has never been consistently studied. A major concern for using a single parameter as a mandatory criterion for prescription and continuation of a preventive treatment is the limited ability to capture the multifaced disability that characterize the migraine spectrum. On the other side, reduction in monthly migraine days (MMDs) represents a pivotal outcome for clinical trials and physicians, but this may not completely highlight the patients' perspective.

The investigators consecutively screened migraine patients attending the outpatient clinic of the Headache Science \& Neurorehabilitation Center of the IRCCS Mondino Foundation (Pavia, Italy).

The patients underwent a 1-year treatment with erenumab subcutaneous administration every 28 days (13 administrations) outside of the AIFA reimbursement program within a compassionate program.

During a baseline visit (T0), a neurologist with expertise in the headache field provided clinical indication to erenumab. At T0, the investigators checked the inclusion/exclusion criteria and the headache diaries of the three preceding months, and performed a full neurologic and general examination and a thorough anamnestic evaluation.

Patients who agreed to participate in the study signed a written informed consent and completed the baseline procedures, including clinical and demographic data recording and completion of a set of questionnaires to assess migraine related disability (MIDAS and HIT-6), psychological comorbidities (HADS-A and HADS-D), quality of life (MSQ), a self-perception of general health (0 to 100 visual analogue scale), and allodynia (ASC-12).

The first erenumab administration (70 mg) was delivered in the hospital setting at T0. After the first administration the patients were observed for 2 hours to monitor possible acute adverse events. The patients were then instructed to perform the following self-administrations of erenumab at home every 28 days (T1 to T12).

The patients returned to the Center every 12 weeks for the follow-up visits (T3 - T6 - T9 - T12), and at T13 for the last visit of the protocol. Monthly headache days (MHDs), monthly migraine days (MMDs), and days of acute drug intake were prospectively recorded in a paper headache diary. At each follow-up visit, the patients completed the same study procedures and clinical scales previously defined. At T3, erenumab dosage was increased in 72 patients up to 140 mg, according to the physician's judgment. All patients were allowed to keep their oral preventive medication with a stable dose across all study period.

The primary outcome was to evaluate the role of MIDAS reduction of at least 50% at T3 (MIDASRes) as a predictor of the long-term clinical outcome. As co-primary outcome, the investigators explored the role of early (T3) 50% MMDs reduction (MMDRes) as predictor of long-term efficacy.

In addition, the investigators evaluated the association between MIDASRes as well as MMDRes and the percentage of patients with a reduction in MMDs of at least 50% in the last 4 weeks of observation period (T13) when compared to baseline (RespondersT13). ResponderT13 were defined according to the IHS Guidelines for clinical trials involving CM patients.

As secondary outcomes, the investigators searched for possible associations between baseline clinical/demographic features and long-term efficacy of erenumab treatment, while, as exploratory outcomes, we described 1-year change in migraine-related disability, anxiety and depression severity, allodynia, and quality of life.

L-carnitine is necessary for fatty-acid metabolism and energy production.

To our knowledge, no placebo-controlled studies have previously evaluated the efficacy of Acetyl-L-carnitine in adults with migraine.

The aims of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy of Acetyl-L-carnitine as a prophylaxis in migraine patients","The study will be a single-centre double-blinded, randomized, placebo controlled crossover study with Acetyl-L-carnitine or placebo. We plan to include 72 patients. The follow up duration will be 36 weeks. The study will be performed according to Good Clinical Practice, and relying partly on the International Headache Society Guidelines for controlled trials of drugs in migraine from 2012 and partly on the guidelines divulged by the International Headache Society task force on trial guidelines for chronic migraine.

After a screening visit including a neurological consultation, eligible patients will sign an informed consent declaration before they enter a 4 week run-in (baseline) period when they keep a headache diary. After 4 weeks they return for the second visit. If they have had 2 or more migraine attacks they are allowed to proceed in the study. If they have less than 2 migraine attacks (required for proceeding in the study), they are allowed to extend the baseline period another 4 weeks. Those who then during the whole 8 week period have on average 2 or more migraine attacks per month are also allowed to proceed. Otherwise they are excluded from the study.

Details of the treatment period The duration of each of the two treatment periods is 12 weeks. During each period there will be one telephone contact at the start of each treatment period to remind patients to start with medicines, and one after 2 weeks to check compliance and side effects. In the second last week of every treatment period there will be a doctor and nurse visit with drug accounting and dispensing of new medicines for the next period. At this visit one will ensure that the patient has just enough medicines left to finish the period before the wash-out. As recommended in crossover studies, the participants enter a washout period of 4 weeks between the two treatment periods, to reduce the risk of carryover effect.

Randomization Randomization will be generated using a computerized procedure. A randomization list containing 72 patient numbers is made before the start of the study, and the patient number is then indicated on a package with medicines for that patient. The study has a crossover design, and the two different treatment periods (active or placebo) can arise to two different treatment sequences (AP or PA). Patients are therefore randomized in blocks of 4 where one of these two treatment sequences is assigned to each patient in random order.

It is a chronic disorder characterized by recurrent moderate and severe headaches, mostly associated with a few symptoms in the autonomic nervous system. Migraine consists of recurrent headache attacks accompanied by neurological, gastrointestinal, and autonomic symptoms.

Migraine is the most common chronic headache in epidemiological studies. Studies have shown that migraine affects 12% of the general population. The aim of migraine treatment is to reduce the frequency, duration, and severity of migraine attacks, to reduce the losses caused by migraine, and increase the quality of life.

In the treatment of migraine, non-pharmacological treatment is as important as pharmacological treatment. Some individuals prefer drug-free treatment methods because of the side effects drugs. In recent years, as the mechanisms of headaches have been better understood, significant developments have been made in treatment methods. Different physiotherapy and rehabilitation methods have been used for treatment. There are studies in which cold application is used in migraine patients, but a study evaluating the effectiveness of cold application has not been found in the literature. The systemic effects of cold have two main purposes: to maintain the current body temperature and to produce energy to raise the fallen body temperature. Knowing both the local and systemic effects of cold guides its use in treatment. The aim of this study was to diagnose migraine.

Migraine has a prevalence of 10% in men and 25% in women in Canada. The treatment of migraine is based on patient education (lifestyle habit modification, trigger avoidance), and pharmacological acute treatment and prophylaxis. A multidisciplinary approach allows a repartition of tasks between different health professionals.

In a 2010 meeting, the Canadian Headache Society members supported the concept of Headache Centers, and a headache nurse was judged as an essential component of such centers.

Gaul has reviewed the structured multidisciplinary approach that could be used in a headache centre and the existing studies using such structures. Five studies did include a headache nurse. No study did observe the impact of a nurse only. Resources in medical care are limited. One study did use a program of 96 hours, which does not seem realistic on the long-term and for a large pool of patients in a public hospital. Patients are not always able to pay for paramedical help such as physiotherapy and psychotherapy. Even if they do, finding a specialized therapist for chronic headache is difficult. Defining the role of a nurse and demonstrating the impact on patient care is therefore a first step in the concept of a headache center. Possible roles of a headache nurse according to Gaul are patient education, follow-up of the treatment plan, addressing patient queries, and monitoring of patient progress. The headache nurse may also participate in research projects. In a hospital Headache Clinic, the nurse may be involved in intra-venous treatments and blood sampling for research.

In summary, evidence to demonstrate the impact of a nurse in a headache clinic is lacking. We propose to study this aspect prospectively. A study with positive findings would encourage health ministers to fund and support headache nurses for headache centers across Canada for headache management. Chronic headache and therefore chronic migraine would be a focus of such centers, since most patients seen in specialized centers are chronic.

HYPOTHESIS: The addition of a headache nurse to the headache team will help the CHUM Migraine Clinic to improve treatment outcome, and reduce the burden of headache. This multidisciplinary approach will also allow a higher efficiency of the team.","STUDY DESIGN:

The goal of this study is to compare two treatment approaches for migraineurs. The first approach will be based on the physician only and is limited to fixed appointments (control group). The second approach will be based on a team involving a headache nurse (active group) who will participate in patient education and follow-up. The goal is to improve patient outcome but also physician productivity.

First 100 patients (control group, phase 1): patients with episodic and chronic migraine will be screened, sign consent and be enrolled. They will be seen by the physician only, without the nurse's support. This situation will reproduce the actual conditions at the clinic. During this phase, the nurse will be involved in the follow-up of known patients (who will not be included in the protocol) and data collection. She will develop her headache management abilities and help the physicians to develop some educational tools for patients.

Following 100 patients (active group, phase 2) : patients with episodic and chronic migraine will be screened and enroled. They will be seen by the physician and nurse team, with a treatment plan tailored to specific needs including regular scheduled visits, follow-up of chronification factors and educational sessions.

1. The proportion of patients achieving significant pain reduction at 30 minutes will be higher in the ketamine treatment group compared to the placebo group.
2. The proportion of patients experiencing pain response, defined as \<50% reduction in the visual analog score compare to the baseline and a reduction of the 4-Point Pain Intensity Categorical Scale to a 1 or 0, will be higher for patients receiving ketamine compared to those receiving the placebo.
3. Patients treated with ketamine for headache will experience lower recurrence rates within 24 hours
4. Ketamine will demonstrate an adequate safety profile.

The last two questions will be exploratory and not included in the power analysis.

It is expected that ketamine will demonstrate a satisfactory safety profile with limited side effects. The proportion of patients attaining pain response is expected to be higher in the ketamine treatment group compared to placebo. It is also expected that patients treated with ketamine alone will be less likely to experience a recurring headache within 72 hours of treatment than those treated with placebo and rescue medication.

The primary outcome will be achievement of pain response at 30 minutes after ketamine dose. Achievement of pain response will be defined as reduction in baseline pain score by at least 50% on the NRS scale. Secondary outcomes will include attainment of pain-free state, patient headache relief, recurrence of headache, recovery of functional disability, and need for rescue medication.","INTERVENTIONAL","RANDOMIZED","PARALLEL","TREATMENT",NA,NA,NA,"TRIPLE",NA,34,"ACTUAL","Inclusion Criteria:

Setting:

The study will be conducted at Hamad General Hospital Emergency Department (HGH-ED). Since it is the largest tertiary care medical center in the country, having a busy ED with monthly census exceeding 40,000 (approximately 500,000 annually). Patients with acute limb injury are frequently seen in ED.

Sample size calculation:

300 patients are required to have a 95% chance of detecting, as significant at the 5%level, a decrease in the primary outcome measure from 70% in the control group to 50% in the experimental group. As for the number of subjects to be enrolled in pharmacokinetic study is directly related to both power and cost of the trial (14)\*, we aim a convenience sample of 20 subjects, 10 in each group.

Screening and Randomization:

All adult patients (age above 18-65 years) presenting with Acute limb injury will be assessed by the available physician initially. Patient's hospital identification number will be put into the study registry. The registry will assure all consecutive patients are screened. Once an eligible patient is identified the physicians will page the research assistant, who will be available in the emergency department from 6 am to 2 pm on week days. After meeting the inclusion criteria and the subject agrees to participate, written consent will be obtained. The enrolled participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio, to one of the two groups- either intramuscular diclofenac or oral diclofenac, from the trial packet available in the stock.

A computer generated block randomization sequence will be generated and stored with sequential coding known to the clinical pharmacist only. Within the randomized sequence, another stratified randomized sequence will be generated for the 20 subjects to be enrolled for pharmacokinetic trial only during the morning shifts. In case of adverse reaction form will be filled and medical research center will be notified for such event.

Intervention:

Typical trial packet

* Syringe A: 3ml solution, diclofenac 75mg or placebo
* Tablet: 100mg diclofenac tablet or placebo A trial packet will contain one syringe labelled A (3ml) and one tablet labelled B (100mg) in an amber colored zip lock pouch. Each will be labelled with a sticker mentioning a unique code, date of preparation and instructions for administration.

Trial packs A B Combination 1 Intramuscular Diclofenac Oral Placebo Combination 2 Oral Diclofenac Intramuscular Placebo Trial packs will be prepared and kept in a locker ready to be used on a daily basis. The team preparing these packets will have no further part in patient treatment or data recording.

Dosage

* Intramuscular Diclofenac will be available in 75mg/3ml concentration for single dose intramuscular administration.
* Tablet Diclofenac will be available as 100mg tablet for single dose per oral administration.

The protocol dictates to administer syringe ""A"" (3ml) intramuscular, 100mg tablet labeled ""B"" to administer per oral.

Data and sample collection:

Patient enrolled for pharmacokinetic measurement, will have an intravenous line to obtain blood for routine sampling, a hep- lock will be attached to the line, for the withdrawal of repeated samples. Blood samples will be collected only in weekdays and morning shifts from 6am until 2 pm. 3 ml of blood will be withdrawn at time 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 45 and 60 minutes. High- performance liquid chromatography method will be used to determine drug in human plasma as the method is potentially considered to be used for detailed pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and bioequivalence studies of diclofenac in humans. Along with blood sampling patient pain score using a numerical rating scale (NRS) will be used to assess the pain, as for the rest of the patients. Pain scores will be recorded at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 45 and 60, minutes following administration of analgesia. Patients reported pain scores will be recorded contemporaneously and patient will not be reminded of the previous score.

According to the 2016 WHO report, migraine is the second leading cause of years lived with disability, greater than all other neurological diseases combined. Yet, the treatment in migraine is far from optimum; the sufferers often abuse painkillers and complicated with medication overuse headache. Migraine is characterized by the hypersensitivity of the sensory system, potentially attributed to dysfunctional pain modulatory networks located in the deep brain structures, particularly the brainstem. However, the current understanding of these deeply seated, dysregulated pain modulatory circuits in migraine is limited due to technological constraints. Besides, studies with an in-depth analysis of the clinical manifestations (i.e., deep phenotyping) are lacking, and there is no corresponding animal model readily available for translational research. In this project, the investigators propose a multimodal approach to address these issues by applying the technologies and platforms developed by our team to explore the correlation between pain sensitivity and dysregulated connectivities from brainstem to other brain regions. In this four-year project, the investigators will recruit 400 migraine patients and 200 healthy subjects. The investigators aim at decomposing the key brainstem mechanisms underlying dysmodulated pain sensitivity in migraine from 5 comprehensive perspectives: (1) clinical deep phenotyping, (2) high-resolution brainstem structural MRI and functional connectivity analysis, (3) innovative brainstem EEG signal detecting technique, (4) multimodal data fusion platform with neural network analysis, and (5) ultrahigh-resolution brainstem-based connectomes, intravital manipulations and recording, and connectome-sequencing in animal models. Moreover, the investigators will collaborate with Taiwan Semiconductor Research Institute to develop a wearable high-density EEG equipment, integrated with a System-on-Chip capable of edge-computing the signal using algorithms derived from our brainstem decoding platform. The ultimate goal is to build a real-time brainstem decoding system for clinical application.","Migraine causes a tremendous disease burden around the world. Migraine is one of the most prevalent neurological disorders and is reported by the WHO as the second leading cause of disease-related disabilities globally (No. 1 in the population under the 50s). There has been no much change in the ranking of disability for migraine for the past two decades, reflecting an unmet need for better treatment options. Even with the recently available calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP)-based treatment, the treatment response versus placebo is still disappointing (6.4-17.6% in acute treatment, 10.2-23.7% in preventive treatment). There is an urgent need to push further the current understanding of the pathophysiology of migraine, based on which novel treatment strategies can be developed. The lack of appropriate research tools hinders the acceleration of migraine research. As a neurological disorder, many neuroimaging studies have been focused on brain alterations; however, the majority focused on the cerebrum. Limited by the currently available neuroimaging and electrophysiological technologies, the deep brain structures especially the brainstem involved in the sensory and nociceptive neurotransmission in migraine, such as the trigeminal nucleus, could only be investigated to a limited extent. Obviously, there is an unmet need for novel technologies that can be used to delineate structural or functional alterations in the brainstem. Elucidation of the role of these deep brain structures may fill the gap in the current understanding of migraine pathophysiology, and pave the way to precise and efficient treatment. Studies restricted to single methodologies are insufficient for the complexity of migraine. Migraine is a complex and dynamic disorder. However, most prior studies were limited to single methodologies and provided limited insights into such a multifaceted disorder. Studies with an integrated approach are lacking. An exhaustive examination of the discrete components of a phenotype, i.e., 'deep phenotyping', can help understand different aspects of its clinical manifestations, and facilitate patient classification. Coupled with neuroimaging and electrophysiological research methodologies, a multi-modal decoding approach would help identify a constellation of migraine-specific biosignatures, rather than just one. This can not only provide clues to decipher migraine pathophysiology in various dimensions but also serve as the basis of the development of a prediction algorithm that can be applied in clinical practice.

Findings from previous studies suggest that dysregulation of connectivity within specific brain circuits is part of chronic pain pathophysiology. This study will identify connectivity patterns within those brain circuits as potential signatures for pain- related disability in chronic TMD pain participants. New knowledge regarding these brain connectivity patterns is expected to be significant because it will support improved phenotyping of this heterogeneous participant population. It is also expected that this finding can potentially be extrapolated to other chronic pain conditions, such as back pain, migraine headache, and fibromyalgia that are frequently comorbid conditions in chronic TMD participants.","Evidence of dysregulation of brain circuits in chronic pain in general and in chronic temporomandibular disorder (TMD) pain specifically is well documented. Among putative brain circuits involved in chronic pain pathophysiology are thalamocortical brain pathways, which transmit nociceptive signals centrally from peripheral tissues. Pathways between the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the periaqueductal gray (PAG) are considered part of an antinociceptive brain circuit, since they are necessary to engage endogenous pain modulation. Dysfunction of endogenous pain modulation has been systematically reported in chronic pain patients, and a meta-analysis of clinical studies of TMD patients done by the Principal investigator and others showed increased pain facilitation and impaired pain inhibition in patients relative to pain-free controls.

Endogenous pain modulation can be assessed by psychophysical methods. For instance, pain facilitation can be assessed with temporal summation of pain (TSP) using brief noxious stimuli presented repeatedly over peripheral tissues at \>0.3 Hz. Pain inhibition can be assessed with conditioned pain modulation (CPM) by presenting noxious stimuli over a body site during concurrent noxious stimuli elsewhere to induce pain inhibition. Neuroimaging studies in pain-free controls showed that functional connectivity within thalamocortical and antinociceptive brain circuits are related to increased TSP and reduced CPM responses, respectively. It is unknown if connectivity patterns within the thalamocortical and antinociceptive brain circuits are altered in chronic TMD patients, reflecting endogenous pain modulation dysfunction. Corticolimbic pathways connecting the mPFC, amygdala and nucleus accumbens are thought to play a key role in chronic pain and specifically, in emotion-driven modulation of nociceptive signals. Recently a longitudinal study showed that functional and structural connectivity patterns determined from neuroimaging data between these regions predict transition from acute to chronic back pain. A population study of TMD pain patients showed that approximately 64% of these patients also present with comorbid low back pain, thus it is possible that chronic TMD pain patients may display brain connectivity patterns that are similar to those identified in persistent back pain patients.

Functional brain connectivity is usually assessed from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), where participants lay at rest during fMRI scans to measure intrinsic functional connectivity (FC). Connectivity patterns within the thalamocortical, corticolimbic and antinociceptive circuits described above were determined using this traditional approach for FC assessment. Recent studies departed from this traditional approach and assessed FC during presentation of noxious stimuli during fMRI data acquisition and identified evoked FC changes. These studies' results suggest that noxious stimuli affect connectivity patterns in brain circuits involved in pain processing in pain-free participants and in fibromyalgia patients. Thus, it is reasonable that psychophysical testing for pain facilitation (e.g., TSP) and pain inhibition (e.g., CPM) could reflect changes in connectivity patterns within brain circuits associated with pain modulation. If confirmed, these evoked connectivity patterns identified from engaging endogenous pain modulation could serve as a ""signature"" for pain modulation in individuals, similar to a ""functional connectome fingerprinting"" demonstrated to predict fluid intelligence in healthy participants using data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP).

Taken together these results suggest new approaches to investigate dysregulation of brain circuits in chronic TMD pain with a focus on brain connectivity, that can serve as unique chronic pain ""signatures"" related to endogenous pain modulation function. There is a critical need to determine the potential of brain circuits' connectivity patterns to serve as signatures for pain- related disability. Addressing this critical need will provide novel ways to identify subgroups of chronic TMD pain patients who respond poorly to treatment. Closing this gap in our knowledge has reasonable potential to provide the opportunity for development of precise and valid brain imaging methods supporting refined phenotyping of chronic TMD pain patients leading to early identification of patients with poor prognosis.

Chronic pain causes suffering to more Americans than heart disease, diabetes and cancer combined, and TMD is the second most commonly occurring musculoskeletal condition resulting in pain and disability after chronic back pain. TMD affects approximately 5-12% of the population, with annual estimates of economic impact ranging between $4 billion per the NIDCR and $32 billion according to a study sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality . Pain-related disability significantly impacts patient's quality of life, and a subgroup of chronic TMD pain patients present with high pain-related disability, as identified by the Graded Chronic Pain Scale (GCPS), and these patients have poor prognoses - even with treatment - and greater health care costs.

About half to two-thirds of individuals with TMD seek treatment, and of those approximately 15% will develop chronic pain. Chronic TMD pain patients present with pain persisting ≥6 months, and it is well accepted that chronic TMD pain pathophysiology includes dysregulation of brain circuits. Recent evidence suggests that brain functional and anatomical characteristics, namely connectivity patterns within specific brain circuits, are related to processing, modulation and persistence of pain. Brain connectivity patterns within the thalamocortical circuit are associated with expression of endogenous pain facilitation, while connectivity patterns between prefrontal cortex and brainstem nuclei, an antinociceptive circuit, are related to endogenous pain inhibition. In addition, brain connectivity patterns within corticolimbic pathways involved in the emotion-driven modulation of nociceptive signals predict transition from acute to chronic back pain. These connectivity patterns within thalamocortical, antinociceptive, and corticolimbic brain circuits have not been described in chronic TMD patients, and it is unknown if connectivity patterns within these brain circuits can distinguish chronic TMD patients based on pain-related disability.","OBSERVATIONAL",NA,NA,NA,NA,"COHORT","CROSS_SECTIONAL",NA,NA,95,"ESTIMATED","Inclusion Criteria: Main project

The study will assess if the customized internet-guided CBT-I program will positively improve clinical measures of insomnia and quality of life outcomes in active or retired service members with primary insomnia and associated mild traumatic brain injury.","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) represents a major health problem in United States military service members. Mild traumatic brain injury, also called ""concussion"", accounts for approximately 90% of the overall cases of TBI. Mild TBI (mTBI) is associated with various debilitating symptoms, such as headache, mood disorders, and sleep alterations. A high percentage of service members and veterans with suspected or confirmed mTBI are also diagnosed with insomnia or other sleep disorders.

In-person cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) has been documented as an effective therapy for treating insomnia. However, implementation within the Military Healthcare System (MHS) has been lacking due to lack of appropriately trained practitioners. Additionally, patients may overlook in-person therapy due to significant time commitment.

This study is a double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial to assess internet-guided CBT-I in military service members with insomnia and mTBI. The primary outcome measure for efficacy is the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) with secondary cross-validation using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).

Pain severity and duration correlates with reduced measures of daily functioning, and overall health status. The sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) has been implicated in a variety of cephalalgias. This has been well represented in the literature dating back over a century. Access to this structure can be gained via a small area of mucosa just posterior and superior to the tail of the middle turbinate on the lateral nasal wall. At this aspect, there is no bony boundary to the SPG. Blocking the SPG using local anesthetics relieves pain. Unfortunately, many current interventions are cumbersome, invasive, and expensive. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the Tx360™, a new nasal applicator device, in the treatment of head and face pain and to examine the economic implications. The Tx360™ is a single use device designed to deliver a topical local anesthetic to the specific area of mucosa associated with the SPG.

Participants must have a chronic migraine history with over 15 symptomatic days per month over the past three months. The treatment plan consists of six weeks of treatment, two times per week. Short and longer term assessments will be retrieved and analyzed as detailed in the Study Design.","42 study participants will be included in this double-blind placebo-controlled study. Following enrollment of 42 subjects and completion of the 6-week Treatment Period by all active subjects, an analysis of the treatment effect will be performed for a reassessment of sample size and, if deemed appropriate, the study will continue with enrollment of additional subjects to ensure a more statistically robust interpretation of the data. The results of the statistical analysis will be blinded from Investigators and coordinators. The procedure will be delivered to all subjects who agree to participate, meet inclusion criteria, and sign informed consent.

At Visit 1 following Informed Consent, a physical exam and vital signs will be completed. A medical, headache, and medication history (to include age, sex, height and weight, and duration and location of headache pain, as well as history of ER visits) will be collected on all subjects. Eligible subjects will be provided with a Baseline Headache Diary and instructed to treat migraines for the following month in their usual manner with their usual treatment. The daily Diary will document headache, acute treatment and response, and migraine associated symptoms (nausea, vomiting, light sensitivity, or sound sensitivity) to establish a Baseline number of headache days and severity. Visit 2 will be scheduled for 1 month following Visit 1. Following Visit 1, Visits 2-13 (treatment visits) will be scheduled to occur twice weekly (during the regular Monday - Friday work week) at least 2 days apart. Treatments should not occur on consecutive days.

At Visit 2, the Baseline Headache Diary will be reviewed and those subjects continuing to meet eligibility will be dispensed a 6-week Treatment Period Diary and complete Before Procedure questions to include the Pain Intensity Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), the Modified Pain Characteristic Questionnaire, and a baseline Headache Impact Test-6 (HIT-6), have vital signs completed, and the medical, headache, and medication history updated. Subjects will be randomized 2:1 to Group A or Group B. Group A will receive treatment with 0.3 mL of 0.5% Marcaine delivered bilaterally with the Tx360™ device to the mucosa associated with the SPG. Group B will receive saline substituted for Marcaine delivered bilaterally with the Tx360TM device to the mucosa associated with the SPG.

To maintain the blinding of the treatment groups, neither the Investigator nor research personnel who are involved in evaluating the subject should prepare the study medication. An independent research staff person with no involvement in the study conduct will place study medication (either Marcaine for a subject randomized to Group A or Placebo/saline for a subject randomized to Group B) in a 1cc Luer Lok tip syringe and assemble the syringe and Tx360TM catheter as instructed in training. A label with the subject Drug Number will be placed on the device at that time. The research staff person administering the study medication will verify that the Drug Number assignment is correct.

Both Groups will be given a piece of lemon hard candy as a taste distractor.

At each treatment visit (Visits 2-13), in addition to Before Procedure questions, subjects will complete 15-minute and 30-minute After Procedure questionnaires to include the NRS and, at 30 minutes, the Patient's Global Impression of Change (PGIC). Subjects will take home a questionnaire to include the NRS, PGIC, satisfaction question, and the Modified Pain Characteristic Questionnaire to be completed at 24 hours following treatment and be instructed to return the 24-hour After Procedure questionnaire to the clinic at the next visit.

At Visits 2-15 vital signs will be completed, medications will be updated, and Non-Serious Adverse Events will be collected after the first treatment. Serious Adverse Events will be collected once the informed consent has been signed and throughout the study.

At Visits 5, 8, and 11, the Treatment Period Headache Diary will be collected, reviewed, and re-dispensed.

At Visit 13, the 1-Month Post-Treatment Period Diary will be dispensed.

The subject will return to the clinic at Visit 14 between 24 and 96 hours following the final treatment at Visit 13 to return the 24-hour After Procedure Questionnaire and complete the 1-Month Treatment Period HIT-6. The Treatment Period Diary will be collected.

Radiation-related complications developing months or years after radiation treatment are known as late radiation tissue injury (LRTI) and are estimated to effect 5%-15% of all long-term survivors who have received radiation.

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is a well established treatment of LRTI. Most of the studies evaluating effect of HBOT on LRTI are focused on survival, resolution of tissue damage and improvement in LENT-SOMA scale. Very few studies have addressed effect of HBOT on pain in LTRI. Krahn and colleagues were the first to report the analgesic effect of HBOT in 3 cases of refractory pain in oncological patients with radiation soft tissue injury. Other studies showed significant improvement in pain intensity in patients with breast cancer and pelvic malignancies treated with HBOT for LTRI. In patients that had developed radiation- induced brachial plexopathy, HBOT elicited an increase in warm pain thresholds and a reduction in lymphoedema. A prospective case study of 16 patients with gynecological cancer found no changes with respect to pain and depression outcomes. A trial in patients with radiation induced proctopathy showed that 75% of patients with rectal pain had some improvement, although none experienced a complete resolution of pain symptoms.

There are several mechanisms by which HBOT may elicit analgesic effects. There is a growing body of evidence that HBOT's analgesic effect related to nitric oxide metabolism and endogenous opioid secretion. Furthermore, the inhibition of tumor necrosis factor alph (TNF-α), the production of substance P, and the modulation of serotonergic pathways have all demonstrated a modification in the pain response following HBOT. In animal studies HBOT decreased allodynia and hyperalgesia in different models of neuropathic and inflammatory pain. The long lasting antinociceptive effect of HBOT was found to be dose-dependent in non-injured tissues.

In human studies, HBOT decreased pain and edema and improved function in patients suffering from the complex regional pain syndrome, and improved pain scores and range of motion in patients with idiopathic femoral head necrosis. Women suffering from interstitial cystitis demonstrated a reduction in pelvic pain following weeks and months of HBOT treatment. In patients suffering from idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia HBOT produced a rapid reduction in symptoms and these effects were lasting for 6 months following treatment. HBOT was also found to be an effective treatment for cluster headaches and migraines and alleviated muscle and bone pains in patients with myofascial syndrome, fibromyalgia, and biphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw.

Based on the evidence presented above and HBOT's known analgesic effect in many conditions, the investigators designed this study with the objective to evaluate if HBOT reduces pain, improves depression and impacts on patients quality of life in patients suffering from late radiation tissue injury.

Patients with CADASIL suffer from a variant from migraine that differs from wild type migraine in terms of its severity, progressive nature and underlying pathophysiology. Recurrent stereotypic acute confusional state associated with the headache episodes in patients with CADASIL is a distinctive phenomenon, which if recognized will lead to an earlier and accurate diagnosis of this condition.

Specific Aims:

* Characterize the nature, frequency and severity of migraine in patients with CADASIL.
* Delineate the phenomenon of acute confusional migraine as a distinct subgroup of migraine and establish its prevalence in patients with CADASIL.
* Determine the latency between the onset of neurological symptoms including migraine, and diagnosis of CADASIL and the prevalence of misdiagnosis.","New York University School of Medicine, Division of Neurogenetics is conducting a new research study for patients with CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy). We are inviting anyone age 18 or older with a confirmed diagnosis of CADASIL to participate. We greatly appreciate your help in this regard. Please be assured that if you participate, all the information you, your relatives or your physicians provide will be held in strict confidence.

CADASIL is often misdiagnosed due to lack of awareness of this condition among health care providers and because the disease can closely mimic other neurological conditions. People with CADASIL struggle to find a doctor who has knowledge about this condition. The purpose of this study is to better understand the early symptoms of CADASIL so doctors may learn to diagnose it early.

This research study will be based on review of medical information provided by you or your health care giver. If you are interested, please contact us by telephone. We will mail a questionnaire for you to fill out and return to us, and request a copy of your brain MRI, test results and office notes from your doctor. We will contact some people for a more detailed telephone interview. Your responses and questionnaire are still valuable even if we do not get other records. The estimated time to complete the questionnaire is about two hours. The telephone interview (if applicable) is expected to last for 30 to 45 minutes. It may be helpful to involve a family member or a friend while completing the questionnaire.

Typically, abortive therapy for migraine in many emergency departments begins with oral analgesics such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen. However, many patients with inadequate pain relief after oral analgesics will require intravenous (IV) medications to abort their migraine symptoms. These medications can take up to thirty minutes or more for the onset of action to begin, potentially leaving patients in significant pain during that time. Also, obtaining IV access in children can be time-consuming and technically difficult, further delaying time to pain relief. Subjects will be given either intranasal lidocaine or placebo while awaiting IV placement and IV metoclopramide administration.

Since the first live birth after an IVF-FET (frozen embryo transfer), recent years have seen a dramatic rise in the number of FET cycles. Three endometrial preparation protocols for frozen-thawed embryo transfer, including artificial, natural, modified natural protocol, have been studied and applied to maximize treatment outcomes. However, those methods are being applied empirically as their efficacy and safety are yet to be determined. The objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness and safety of those protocols.","This trial will be conducted at My Duc Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam. Women who are potentially eligible will be provided information about the trial as long as their stimulation cycles are initiated. Screening for eligibility will be performed by treating physicians on day 2 of the menstrual cycle in the subsequent frozen embryo transfer cycles. Patients will be provided a copy of the informed consent documents. Written informed consent will be obtained by the investigator from all women before the enrolment. Women will be randomized (1:1:1) to AC (artificial cycle) or NC (natural cycle), or mNC (modified natural cycle) protocols using block randomization with a variable block size of 6 or 9 by an independent study coordinator via telephone, using a computer-generated random list (block size of 6, or 9).

Artificial protocol The endometrium is prepared using oral estradiol valerate (Valiera®; Laboratories Recalcine) 8 mg/day, ranging from the second or fourth menstruation day. The endometrial thickness will be monitored from day six onwards, and vaginal progesterone (Utrogestan®; Besins) 800 mg/day will be initiated when endometrial thickness reaches ≥7 mm. Estradiol exposure must be lasting for ≥9 days before progesterone administration. Embryo transfer will be scheduled by the time of the initiation of progesterone and embryo stages. In cases where a dominant follicle emerged, serum LH and progesterone will be determined to rule out luteinization. If LH concentrations are \<13 IU and progesterone levels \<15 nmol/l, luteinization will deem not to have occurred, and FET was performed.

Natural protocol The first ultrasound scan will be performed on the second to the fourth day of the menstrual cycle to identify any problem related to the patient's uterus or adnexa. The second ultrasound will be performed on the sixth day of the cycle. Daily ultrasound and serum estradiol and LH level evaluation will be performed when the mean diameter of the dominant follicle of ≥14 mm. LH surge initiation is defined as a concentration of 180% above the latest serum value available in that patient with a continued rise thereafter to a level of 20 IU/l or more detected by the ECLIA method (Roche Cobas® E 801, Roche Diagnostics, Germany). Embryo transfer will be scheduled by the time of the initiation of LH and embryo stages.

modified Natural protocol The first ultrasound scan will be performed on the second to the fourth day of the menstrual cycle to identify any problem related to the patient's uterus or adnexa. A second ultrasound scan will be performed on the sixth day of the cycle; if there is at least one follicle with a diameter of ≥12 mm, an ultrasound scan will be performed daily. When the dominant follicle's mean diameter is ≥16 mm, human chorionic gonadotropin - hCG (Ovitrelle® 250 μg; Merck, Kenilworth, NJ, USA) will be injected to trigger ovulation. Embryo transfer will be scheduled by the time of the hCG injection and embryo stages.

Serum progesterone level was also evaluated using the electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (Elecssys Progesterone III, Cobas®, Roche diagnosis, Germany) with a CV of 5.2%.

Serum progesterone was measured at 3 time points:

* 1st sample: On day 2 to day 4 of the cycle, before starting the endometrial preparation regime
* 2nd sample:

  * For AC protocol: Before administration of vaginal progesterone
  * For mNC protocol: Before hCG administration
  * For NC protocol: When an LH surge initiation was recorded, i.e., serum LH measured 20 IU/L or more
* 3rd sample: On the day of frozen embryo transfer at 8 a.m. Cycle cancellation

  * Artificial protocol: When the endometrial thickness is below 7mm after a duration of estradiol administration of ≥21 days or the emergence of a dominant follicle.
  * Natural cycle protocol: When there is no development of follicle, or no dominant follicle (≥14 mm), or no onset of LH surge observed after a duration of ≥21 days or unexpected spontaneous ovulation appears.
  * modified Natural cycle protocol: When there is no developing follicle (\>16mm) observed after a duration of ≥21 days or pre-hCG unexpected spontaneous ovulation appears.
  * Both protocols: When there is no embryo surviving after thawing.

Frozen embryo transfer:

A maximum of 2 day-3 and one day-5 embryos will be thawed on the day of embryo transfer, three days after the start of progesterone. Two hours after thawing, surviving embryos will be transferred into the uterus under ultrasound guidance using a soft uterine catheter (Gynétics®, Belgium).

A series of progesterone levels evaluation will be performed at three times: (1) at the start of the cycle, (2) Before the time the embryo transfer is scheduled, (3) On the day of embryo transfer.

The objective of this study is to determine if metoclopramide, a drug commonly used in the treatment of migraine headache, will be effective in relieving PCH and in preventing PCS.

Eligible patients will have a history of a concussion resulting in headache within the past 24 hours.

The primary hypothesis is that the administration of intravenous metoclopramide will be effective in relieving the symptoms of acute post traumatic headache in ED patients with minor head injury.

The secondary hypothesis is that the administration of intravenous metoclopramide will also be effective in reducing the incidence of chronic post-concussive syndrome in ED patients with minor head injury. The research question is ""Does the administration of intravenous metoclopramide at a dose of 10 or 20 mg to adult ED patients experiencing headache following a minor head injury result in a significant decrease in pain severity as measured on a 10cm visual analogue scale, as compared to placebo?""

Only patients who meet the following inclusion criteria will be recruited:

1. History of blunt head trauma within preceding 24 hours
2. Immediate and transient post traumatic impairment of neurological functions such as alteration of consciousness, amnesia, disorientation, or disturbance of vision or equilibrium.
3. Onset of headache within one hour of trauma.
4. Significant intra-cranial injury excluded by CT scan or clinical assessment.

Exclusion criteria will include age less than or equal to 16 years, known or suspected pregnancy, known hypersensitivity or intolerance to metoclopramide, inability to give informed consent, known gastrointestinal hemorrhage, perforation or obstruction, known seizure disorder, known pheochromocytoma, concurrent significant CNS depression due to drugs or alcohol, or concurrent treatment for psychiatric illness.

Patients will be randomized and asked to grade their headache pain severity on a 10-cm non-hatched visual analog scale (VAS) before the administration of the study drugs. They will then receive either 10 mg (2ml) of metoclopramide or 2 ml of saline placebo. After 15 minutes they will again complete the VAS. If their headache is not satisfactorily relieved they will be offered a second dose of study drug and the VAS will be completed again 30 minutes later. Patients will be contacted 1, 4 and 8 weeks later in order to complete a telephone questionnaire to assess for PCS symptoms.

The primary comparison will be between the proportion of patients achieving significant pain relief in each of the two study arms and a difference of 20% of greater in these proportions will be considered clinically significant. A t-test of two proportions will be used and p less than or equal to 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.

To date, no treatment guidelines exist for PTH management except for conservative modalities, such as cognitive rest, physical therapy, and neuropathic pain medications, all of which have minimal evidence to support them.

The investigators propose a randomized, controlled, clinical trial and prospective follow-up study to evaluate the effect of invasive procedures such as occipital nerve block (ONB) and cervical medial branch block (CMBB) in the management of PTH.

Adolescents and adults (14-45 years of age) will be recruited from Boston Children's Hospital and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Pain clinics, Concussion clinics and Headache clinics.","Headaches and neck pain following a concussion are potentially treatable and resolve over time. Nerve blockade may enhance the recovery of appropriate neural circuits involved in the pathophysiology of a chronic headache. Currently, no evidence-based guidelines exist for treatment of PTH. Adoption of ""brain rest"" for 1-2 weeks, followed by gradual return to activity and avoiding ""second-impact syndrome"" are current practice. The use of medications controlling neuropathic pain is of partial benefit for some. Adverse effects like sedation, mood changes, cardiac side effects of pharmacologic agents are often not compatible with the demands of athletics. For those patients where sports performance is paramount, they may therefore not be able to tolerate regular medications. The incidence of chronic post-concussive headaches (\> 3 months) at one year is 8.4% - 35% and at four years is up to 25%. Therefore, patients can have a significant disability from their post-traumatic headaches for many years after their injury. Without appropriate treatment, these headaches can remain as chronic headaches. Over-the-counter and other symptomatic medication overuse can exacerbate and prolong PTH significantly, secondary to rebound headaches. Successful treatment is essential since PTH limits return to sports as well as more general activities of living, such as work and school. Most interventions currently in use partially help and take several weeks to months for a noticeable benefit. PTH interventions, including ONB and CMBB, are employed in the treatment of primary headache disorders and neck pain from cervical arthritis and may provide more improved, faster and more sustained pain relief in many patients. Also, given that most of the action of the nerve blocks is local, there are significantly fewer side effects than in more standard headache medications. Injections that use corticosteroids may be beneficial in a post-traumatic headache by reducing inflammation and therefore mechanical allodynia. Injection of corticosteroids in the cervical facet joint area has shown up to 13 months of pain relief. This prolonged effect may be secondary to central pain modulation. Ultimately, nerve blocks may be a more effective and efficient post-traumatic headache given the onset of effect and the minimal side effects.

To date, there have been no prospective studies of procedural treatments for medically refractory PTH and none in the adolescent and young adult population in whom football injuries are common. Despite the frequent clinical practice of using ONB and CMBB for occipital neuralgia, cervical arthritis, and cervicogenic headaches, there has been no adequate scientific investigation into the use of these interventions for PTH. Given that PTH is typically felt to be secondary to an inflammatory reaction to trauma, the use of injection of corticosteroids may be more effective in PTH than in common headache disorders.

A headache diary enables the physician to understand the headache characteristics as well to establish the triggers causing the precipitation of episodes. The other important measure to ensure good outcomes is compliance to medications in those who have been prescribed prophylaxis. Migraine prophylaxis is by pills that have to be taken everyday at fixed time to ensure best outcomes.

The investigators recently reported frequent subjective complaints of chronic pain, migraine and headache during wakefulness in adult sleepwalkers. They also described frequent analgesia during severe and injuring episodes, suggesting a relationship between dissociated brain activity and nociceptive dysregulation. However, this study did not included objective nociceptive measures and the retrospective assessment of perceived pain during parasomnia episodes over a lifetime span might also introduce a recall bias.

The aims of the present study are to measure objective pain sensitivity in patients with NREM parasomnias and matched controls during 1) parasomniac episodes, 2) light NREM sleep and SWS, and 3) wakefulness.

Fifteen adults with severe NREM parasomnia and 15 age and sex-matched controls will be recruited. A 25 hours (8 AM to 9 AM) sleep deprivation protocol followed by auditory stimulations during SWS will be used to trigger parasomniac episodes. Thermoalgic stimulations of graduate intensity will be applied during wakefulness (8 PM) to determine the nociceptive threshold. During the recovery sleep following the sleep deprivation, the investigators will apply repeated subthreshold thermoalgic stimulations in NREM stage 2, SWS and triggered parasomniac episodes and report the behavioural/neurophysiologic nociceptive responses.

The investigators hypothesized a lower nociceptive threshold during wakefulness in sleepwalkers and a decrease of the arousabiliy during SWS and parasomniac episodes.

There are now a wide variety of formulations of ibuprofen available on market in which the active ingredient, ibuprofen, is either as the free acid, salt or salt in situ. As a result of differences between these formulations, differences in absorption and time to effectiveness are achieved. Rates of absorption are commonly assessed using pharmacokinetic (PK) studies, where the time taken for therapeutic plasma concentration levels to be reached can be determined, with associated absorption profiles being generated.

Before absorption can occur the product must disintegrate in the stomach and empty into the small intestine. Gamma scintigraphy may be used to assess the disintegration rate (of tablets/capsules/caplets) by acquiring images of the investigational medicinal product (IMP) in vivo. Through the use of radiolabelled dosage forms, it enables the visualisation of key stages preceding absorption, including tablet disintegration and the rate of gastric emptying. The assessment of these stages, which are required prior to absorption in the small intestine, may be useful in gaining an understanding of the differences between the dosage forms. The main purpose of this study is to visualise and determine the rate of disintegration and subsequent availability for absorption of different ibuprofen formulations, by gamma scintigraphy.

Alopecia is one of the most common side effects of CT seriously impairing patient quality of life and body image. While other CT associated side effects can be controlled by supportive treatment strategy, adequate preventive measures for alopecia have been lacking. New evidence supports the efficacy of scalp cooling for alopecia prevention during CT.","Scalp cooling using cooling caps has been identified as an effective treatment option against CT-induced alopecia in numerous European countries. Originally, crashed ice was used to cause vasoconstriction and consequently diminish CT uptake to hair follicles during CT. Soon, this method turned out impractically and has been displaced by cooling caps which allow a constant cooling of the scalp while easy handling.

However, effectiveness of scalp cooling depends on different factors such as hair texture, chemotherapy regimen, dose of chemotherapy, cooling time, and compliance of the patient.

Recent studies focused on alopecia prevention more than on patients' quality of life and satisfaction. Therefore, data on routine use of cool caps with a focus on efficiency in daily routine and patients' acceptability are missing.

Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) provide results assessed by the use of a patient's report about his or her own health condition ""without amendment or interpretation by a clinician or anyone else"" and are a valuable source of information when evaluating clinical interventions or treatment toxicity in intervention studies in oncology.

We hope to build the world's first high-frequency MEG/MEG/ECoG/SEEG database for the developing brain. HFBS include high-gamma activation/oscillations, high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), ripples, fast ripples, and very high frequency oscillations (VHFOs) in the brain.

To reach the goals, we have developed several new MEG/EEG methods: (1) accumulated spectrogram; (2) accumulated source imaging; (3)frequency encoded source imaging; (4) multi-frequency analysis; (5)artificial intelligence detection of HFOs; (6) Neural network analysis (Graph Theory); and (7) others (e.g. ICA, virtual sensors).","I. PURPOSE OF STUDY The purpose of this study is to go beyond the conventional analyses of brain signals in a narrow frequency band (typically 1-30 Hz) by measuring brain signals from infraslow to very fast (0.01 - 2800 Hz). Specifically, we propose to study physiological HFOs in sensorimotor, auditory, visual and language evoked magnetic fields and to investigate pathological HFOs in epilepsy, migraine and other disorders. This is clinical very important for many reasons.

For example, There are 400,000 to 600,000 patients with refractory epilepsy in the United States. Since those patients' seizures cannot be controlled by any drugs, epilepsy surgery is one potential cure. Accurate identification of ictogenic zones, the brain areas cause seizures, is essential to ensure a favorable surgical outcome. Unfortunately, the existing method, electrocorticography (ECoG), needs to place electrodes upon the brain surface to capture spikes (typically, 14-70 Hz), which is very risky and costly. The present study is to use magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) to identification of ictogenic zones noninvasively. To reach the goal, we proposed to detect high frequency (70-2,500 Hz) and low frequency (\< 14 Hz) brain signals with advanced signal processing methods. Our central hypothesis is that high frequency brain signals will lead to significantly improved rates of seizure freedom as compared with spikes. This hypothesis is based on recent reports that high frequency brain signals are localized to ictogenic zones.

Building on our unique resources and skills, we plan to address four aims. First, we will quantify the spatial concordance between MEG and ECoG signals in both low and high frequency ranges. We hypothesize that Ictogenic zones determined by invasive ECoG can be non-invasively detected and localized by high frequency MEG signals. Second, we will quantify the occurrence concordance between EEG and ECoG signals in both low and high frequency ranges. We hypothesize that epileptic high frequency signals from the ictogenic zones determined by invasive ECoG can also been non-invasively detected by EEG, although the localization of EEG may be significantly inferior to that of MEG. Third, we will determine whether epilepsy surgery based on multi-frequency signals (low frequency brain signals, spikes, and high frequency brain signals), instead of spikes alone, leads to a better seizure outcome. We hypothesize that epilepsy surgery guided by high frequency brain signals detected with MEG/EEG will significantly improve surgical outcomes. Fourth, we will determine whether multi-frequency analyses provide more information than single frequency analysis for estimating epileptogenic zones for pre-surgical ECoG electrode implantation. We hypothesize that covering all brain areas generating low to high frequency epileptic activity is the prerequisite to localize multiple ictogenic zones for favorable post-surgical outcomes. To yield definitive results, we propose a multi-center study to determine if high frequency brain signals are new biomarkers for significantly improve epilepsy surgery outcomes. According to our pilot data that localization of epileptogenic zones with MEG high frequency signals can increase about 30-40% post-operative seizure freedom, the proposed study should result in millions of intractable epilepsy patients being seizure free. This study also lays a foundation for using low and high frequency brain signals as new biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment of many other disorders (e.g. migraine, autism).","OBSERVATIONAL",NA,NA,NA,NA,"OTHER","PROSPECTIVE",NA,NA,420,"ESTIMATED","Inclusion Criteria:

In addition in BPD, the suicide rate might be as high as 8-10%. the presence of BPD also interferes with response to treatment of physical and psychiatric comorbidities, such as migraine, HIV, anxiety disorders and substance use disorders.

BPD patients frequently describe their life as unpredictable and stressful. As stated in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.), borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious mental illness characterized by a pervasive pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image and effect, as well as marked impulsivity. This condition arises in early adulthood or adolescence, leading to severe functional impairment and subjective discomfort. Unfortunately, diagnosis and treatment of BPD is often delayed, leading to a less favorable outcome. This is especially true in patients with early onset BPD, in whom the detection and subsequent therapeutic intervention on the disorder is usually further put off. Indeed, in the last two decades, there has been a great sensibilization towards personality disorder (PD)diagnosis in adolescence, reflected in the significant increase in empirical studies regarding this matter, and in the legitimization of adolescent PD diagnosis in psychiatric nomenclature (DSM-5 and ICD-11), as well as in national treatment guidelines in the UK and Australia. Nonetheless, a recent review by Sharp has stressed how scientific evidence and national practice guidelines are yet to penetrate routine clinical care. Indeed, in common clinical practice diagnosis and consequently, treatment of BPD is usually delayed due to underestimation of symptoms and, often, hesitation to diagnose this disorder in younger individuals. BPD is progressively considered a life expectancy formative disorder that exists on a layered continuum of severity. The recent studies for the adults who have BDP disease couldn't find a pharmacological treatment for them. The symptoms treatment with pharmacotherapy is not accurate for the treatment of BDP in adults, the pharmacotherapy should not be used for adolescent BPD. The only study exist is about the using of omega-3 fatty acids and the increase risk of psychosis. Overall, there is no pharmacological treatment for the BDP disease for adults, also the risks of iatrogenic and poly-pharmacy toxicity is high in these young people. The other comorbidities of the disease are treated from the clinical for adolescents, using the pharmacological therapy when needed.

Pain clinics are specially equipped to perform intentional pain procedures to manage pain. However, there remain groups of patients what neither benefit from pharmacological nor from interventional pain procedures. Other methods have shown only minor benefits such as hypnosis or cognitive behavioral therapy. Therefore, other techniques need to be investigated.

Light therapy has been shown to have significant biological effects on humans. For example, light therapy is used to manage depression. Several clinical trials have shown that certain wavelengths of light can improve wound healing, decrease temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMJ) pain, and decrease fear of back pain. In these trials, light was directed at the site of pain. In an attempt to better understand the effect of different wavelengths of light, pre-clinical studies were conducted using rats. The investigators have shown green and blue Light emitting diode, (LED) light produced antinociception (analgesia) and reversed neuropathic pain associated with several models of chronic pain. The analgesic effect of light was completely blocked when rats had their eyes covered, this suggests that the analgesic effects seen are mainly due to systemic effect through the visual system.

Preliminary experiments on rats suggest that this effect is mediated through the endogenous opioids and cannabinoid system.

The investigators believe that LED light is a safe alternative to pharmacological intervention to manage pain by stimulating the endogenous endorphin and cannabinoid systems. The investigators initial target participants with history of HIV, chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy and fibromyalgia. Participants will be divided into 2 groups. The first group will be a control group exposed to white LED light. The second group will be exposed to green LED light, respectively. Participants will be asked to take LED light home and will be asked to set in a dark room for 2 hours daily for 3 months with their LED light on. At the end of the 3 months trial, the investigator will assess their pain intensity, analgesic use, and overall quality of life. The investigators hypothesis is that participants exposed to green and blue light will have less use of analgesics and will have better life quality.","During the initial visit, the investigator will collect several pieces of data from participants that are considered part of the routine care, if you are being seen in the clinic, this information will also be used for research purposes. Initially the investigator will ask participants to provide their age, gender, work status, disability status, type of work, whether a previous pain physician has evaluated or provided treatment in the past, if there is any ongoing litigation, a detailed description of the pain (burning, electrical, shooting...etc.) and its location. If the participants are being seen in the clinic for their normal care a detailed physical examination assessing the motor strength of the upper extremities, sensation to light touch and reflexes that is part of the standard of care will be provided for the participants. The participants will be asked to give a numerical value for their pain (a scale from 0-10 where 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst pain imagined). Two questionnaires will be provided for the participants to complete which are not standard of care. The first one is the EuroQol Group (EQ-5D) which provide an over assessment of the quality of life. The second is a medication log to document their analgesics use. If the participants are being evaluated via telephone call, the same questions will be conducted, but no physical exam will be provided.

The participants will be assigned to either a white, or green light group. The participants have 50% chance of being in either group. Once the participants are assigned a light group, the participants will be given a strip of Light emitting diode, (LED) light that correspond to their color group. The participants will be asked to take and use the LED strip in a dark room in their house every day for two hours to be exposed to the light, the participants will do this for 10 weeks. The study start date and the outcome assessment timeline will begin from the date of your first exposure to the assigned light. The participants will be asked to complete their weekly questionnaires and daily log, these will be given to the participants on their first clinic visit or sent to the participants if they live out of town. There will be several follow up appointments as detailed below. There is a chance the participants may be asked to cross over into a different group from the one the participants were assigned, there will we a 2 week washout period, then return to clinic for light assignment then light exposure for 10 week, similar visits as described below.

For the follow up clinic visit or phone call (Week 10), data similar to the information gathered at the initial visit will be collected. The description of the pain (burning, electrical, shooting...etc.) and its location will be reviewed. A physical examination assessing for pain and sensation to light touch that is part of the standard of care will be provided for the participants. At the end of the study, the participants will be asked to return the LED strip, their logs and questionnaires.

Furthermore, patients with neck pain show a decrease in motor control of the jaw, without having any other signs of TMD. Similarly, studies in patients with TMD have only found an indication for poorer neck muscle function. Patients with TMD also show a decrease in bite force and force steadiness compared to healthy controls.

The current study will take a closer look at the jaw muscle function of in patients with TTH, with and without neck pain.","Tension-type headache (TTH) and migraine has been found to coincide with cervical pain, musculoskeletal dysfunction and/or temporomandibular disorders (TMD). The possible interplay between these three symptoms/disorders, headache, neck pain and TMD, have not been studied completely, only in sections. Earlier studies have revealed an association between different headache types and neck pain and discussed the possible role of the cervical muscles. Patients with TTH and (chronic) migraine exhibit lower muscle strength in the neck extensor muscles compared to healthy controls. Patients with neck pain show a decrease in motor control of the jaw, without having any other signs of TMD. Similarly, studies in patients with TMD have only found an indication for poorer neck muscle function while patients with TMD also show a decrease in bite force and force steadiness compared to healthy controls. It is however, unknown if bite force and force steadiness are similarly impaired in patients with headache and/or neck pain.

Muscle tenderness increases with increasing headache frequency and intensity in TTH while this association is not present in migraine patients. Tenderness has a significant influence on the neck muscle function in TTH patients and there is a negative correlation between Total Tenderness (TTS) and muscle force. There is currently, however, no clear understanding of the influence of tenderness on the function of jaw muscles in TTH patients.

The current project will increase the investigator's understanding of the interplay or dependency between the function of the jaw and neck muscles in TTH patients. If a comorbidity of TMD or neck pain make TTH patients more prone to dysfunction of jaw and neck muscles, this may lead to a subgrouping of these TTH patients.

Background:

Headaches are a frequent occurrence in children and adolescents, making them the most commonly reported pain complaint when seeking medical attention. (Genizi 2013) The prevalence of migraine shows an increase from 3% during the preschool years to 23% during high school years. (Al-Twaijri 2002) The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected the well-being of children and adolescents, impacting various facets of their physical and mental health. Disrupted routines, prolonged periods of social isolation, increased screen time, and heightened stress and anxiety related to the pandemic have raised concerns about the potential amplification in frequency and severity of childhood migraines. Numerous studies have documented an upsurge in migraine symptoms and frequency among children during the pandemic.( Bonuccelli 2023, Dedeoglu 2023 Caronna 2023) Factors such as changes in sleep patterns, dietary habits, physical activity levels, and emotional stress contribute to the worsening of migraine in this population. ( Powers 2003, Riva 2006) Additionally, restricted access to healthcare services and disrupted follow-up care during the pandemic pose challenges for the management and treatment of childhood migraine. (Apetti 2020, Verhagen 2021, Reyes-Alvarez 2023) It is imperative for healthcare professionals to acknowledge these difficulties and provide appropriate support and interventions to mitigate the pandemic's impact on children with migraine. Future research should delve into the underlying mechanisms connecting pandemic-related factors to the exacerbation of migraine, enabling the development of targeted strategies for prevention and management.

Our study aimed to explore COVID-19 pandemic on the executive functions (EF), and quality of life of children with migraine and healthy controls. We compared EF between children with migraine and healthy controls. Then, both groups were further divided to children who were affected by COVID-19 those who were not affected by COVID-19. Comparisons within and between groups of EF, anxiety, participation and QOL were performed. Among children with migraine, we examined the implications of COVID-19 restrictions on EF; we examined the correlations between EF, anxiety, participation and QOL. Based on the correlations results, we examined whether EF, anxiety, migraine severity and participation predicted QOL.

Research Objective:

Our hypotheses were that: (1) children with migraine would have significantly lower EF, higher anxiety, lower participation and QOL than healthy controls. (2) When comparing children affected by COVID-19 those who were not affected by COVID-19 withing and between groups: children with migraine who were affected by COVID-19 would have the lowest EF, highest anxiety, lowest participation and QOL. (3) Among children with migraine: significant correlations would be found between migraine severity (Ped MIDAS), EF, anxiety, participation and QOL; (4) EF, anxiety, migraine severity and participation would significantly predict QOL.

Study Population:

The research will include 75 children between the ages of 6 and 18 years, diagnosed with Migraine, who are under follow-up at the Pediatric Neurology Clinic in Bnei Zion.

A control group of 75 children without chronic diseases, assessed during routine visits at the Pediatric Neurology Clinic or for other reasons, will also be included.

Research Methods:

For the study group only:

Medical Assessment: A prospective medical history including a thorough headache history and physical and neurological assessment by a pediatric neurologist, were done in all children, during the visit at the pediatric neurology clinic. All children met the diagnostic criteria for migraine, according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3) (++).

PedMIDAS: Headache related disability was evaluated by the PedMIDAS questionnaire. It was developed to assess migraine disability in pediatric and adolescent patients and has been tested and validated for ages 4 to 18 (++).

For all participants:

Health status questionnaire- A thorough questionnaire about the general health of all participants, including information about COVID-19 - as whether the child was infected by the virus.

Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functions (BRIEF) - The BRIEF is a behavioral rating measure for children and youth aged 5-18 years, that aims to measure the child's EF as expressed in daily life situations (for example: ""becomes upset with new situations""; ""has a messy desk""; ""disturbed by change of teacher or class""; ""does not check work for mistakes""; ""has trouble concentrating on chores, schoolwork) . In the present study we used the BRIEF parents' report. The BRIEF includes 86 items that measure various EF and are summarized into two scales: Behavioral Regulation Index (BRI) (which includes the inhibition, shifting and emotional control scales), and the Metacognition Index (MI) (which includes the initiation, working memory, planning, organization of materials and monitoring scales). The Global Executive Composite (GEC) total score is generated from both BRI and MI scores. Parents rate how frequent the child express the behavior described in each BRIEF item on a Likert scale that ranges from 1 (infrequently) to 3 (often). All row scores are converted to a standard scores. A total cut-off standard score of 65 indicates deficiencies in executive functions. As higher is the scores, the worse are the EF. The BRIEF has good psychometric properties (Gioia et al., 2015; Gioia, Isquith, Guy, \& Kenworthy, 2000; McGill \& Snow, 2021).

The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC) (Spielberger, C. D., Edwards, C. D., Montouri, J., \& Lushene, R. (1973) distinguishes between a general proneness to anxious behavior rooted in the personality and anxiety as a fleeting emotional state. The STAIC S-Anxiety scale consists of twenty statements that ask children how they feel at a particular moment in time. The STAIC T-Anxiety scale also consists of 20 item statements, but subjects respond to these items by indicating how they generally feel. The instrument is designed to be used with upper elementary or junior high school aged children. Higher mean score represents lower anxiety.

The Child and Adolescent Scale of Participation (CASP) (Bedell, 2011) - measures the extent to which children participate in home, school, and community activities compared to children of the same age as reported by family caregivers. The content and methods used in the CASP and CFFS were informed by the International Classification of Functioning (ICF, WHO, 2001), research addressing participation of children / youth with a range of disabilities and factors related to the child, family and physical and social environment that support and or hinder participation. The CASP consists of 20 ordinal-scaled items and four subsections: 1) Home Participation (6 items), 2) Community Participation (4 items), 3) School Participation (5 items), and 4) Home and Community Living Activities (5 items). The 20 items are rated on a four-point scale: ""Age Expected (Full participation),"" ""Somewhat Restricted,"" ""Very Restricted,"" ""Unable."" A ""Not Applicable"" response is selected when the item reflects an activity in which the child would not be expected to participate due to age (e.g., work). Most items are applicable to children who are five and older. Higher scores reflect greater age-expected participation. The CASP has reported evidence of test re-test reliability (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient = 0.94), internal consistency (α ≥ 0.96) and construct and discriminant validity.

The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL( (++ ) - We used Version 4.0 the child's report, which profiles children's Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) in four dimensions: (1) Physical Functioning (eight items), (2) Emotional Functioning (five items), (3) Social Functioning (five items) and (4) School Functioning (five items). A higher order dimension of the Psychosocial Health dimension encompasses emotional and social functioning. The child marks the frequency of problems which occurred in the past one month on a five-point response Likert scale (0 = never a problem; 1 = almost never a problem; 2 = sometimes a problem; 3 = often a problem; 4 = almost always a problem). Items are then transformed into a 0-100-point scale (0 = 100; 1 = 75; 2 = 50; 3 = 25; 4 = 0) to present the HRQoL percentage. A higher percentage indicates a better HRQoL.

As of December 27th 2020, there were more than 79.2 million confirmed cases and more than 1.7 million deaths caused by COVID-19 worldwide (WHO,2020).

Migraine\& tension headacheare considered one of the most disabling chronic neurological diseases, and patients with migraine or tension headache are particularly vulnerable to drastic negative impacts of the pandemic. From heightened levels of psychosocial stress, social isolation , disruption of sleep and dietary habits ,to several COVID-19-specific concerns.

Normally, people with epilepsy (PWE)patients are very sensitive to different factors such as physical or emotional disturbances or environmental and lifestyle changes.Many factors can increase the risk of seizures,i.e., illness and fever, stressful events, sleep deprivation,changes in antiepileptic drugs (AED),use of proconvulsive treatments,to name a few.Some are unavoidable during a sociosanitary crisis like that currently being experienced.

Because of the rapid increase of infections, Government enacted a national state of emergency, limiting public mobility and compelling home confinement and social isolation. This national lockdown, in addition to the direct effects of COVID-19, have dramatically altered the lifestyle and normal routines of the entire population.Therefore, in addition to the risk of neurological involvement that COVID-19 itself has, during the pandemic,different circumstances may negatively impact on seizure control in PWE.","Aim of the study:

Participants will be recruited via the pain and Ob/Gyn clinics and via EPIC. Potential participants might be identified via EPIC records using age, sex, diagnoses, notes, problem list, medications, date of scheduled surgery, name of physician performing the surgery, and phone number.

A research staff member will contact a potential participant and provide a description of the project. Potentially eligible participants will be invited to participate in the study, which will be conducted at Washington University School of Medicine. Participants will also be provided with a written summary or the consent of the study. The consent will be signed electronically, using Docusign e-consent process or remotely during a phone call or a video call (WUSTL Zoom) with a study staff or in person.

Study Design

After confirming the inclusion criteria and signing the consent form, patients with pelvic pain potentially due to endometriosis will complete a 2.5 hours study visit of psychophysical assessments of thermal and pressure stimuli. Patients will also complete various questionnaires including demographic, social, health, behavioral, and psychological questionnaires. . For adolescents, a parent/legal guardian will be asked to assist in completing some of the health-related surveys (i.e., physical developmental survey, health survey, migraine history survey). Obstetric, gynecologic, fertility, and surgical history will be abstracted from the medical record and/or via health history interview. These procedures will be completed before the surgery.

During the surgery, the endometriosis lesions will be excised as part of routine care. At least one lesion will be sent to pathology and one lesion for the study team. In the absence of lesions, peritoneally biopsies of bilateral infra-ovarian fossa will be collected per routine practice. One will be sent to pathology, and one for the study team. Vials of health abdominal peritoneum, and endometrial biopsy (if uterus present) will be collected for study purpose.

Before or on the day of the surgery, blood, urine, and/or saliva samples will be collected for hormonal, immune and genetic testing. Additional samples will be stored in a biobank for future hormonal, immune and/or genetic analyses.

In addition, after the surgery, participants will be asked to complete surveys assessing pain and other symptoms which will be sent every week for the first month and then monthly for 1 year.

After the surgery, participants will have the option to return for additional study visits that will include the same psychophysical procedures and collection of blood (about 20 ml), urine, and/or saliva samples (3 months, 6 months and 1 year after surgery).

During the study period, new about pelvic pain, new/changes in diagnosis, treatment changes (medication titration, physical therapy, mental health, and alternative therapies), surgery related data, additional pain-related diagnoses, and additional markers (i.e., vitamin D, hormone levels) will also be collected via EPIC and/or health history interview.

All study procedures are optional and participants can stop or not complete tests if they want.

Participants need to meet all the inclusion criteria to be included in the study. After consenting and the first study visit, changes in health will not automatically lead to excluding participants from the study. Before the follow-up visits, the investigators will ask the participants about changes in their health (from the last visit). Based on the responses, continuation/withdrawal from the study and/or omission of study activities will be determined at the discretion of the PI and/or study staff.","OBSERVATIONAL",NA,NA,NA,NA,"CASE_ONLY","PROSPECTIVE",NA,NA,120,"ESTIMATED","Inclusion criteria:

Major depressive disorder is defined by depressed mood and/or loss of interest in activities, during most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks. It is usually accompanied by other symptoms, such as fatigue, sleep disturbances, thoughts of guilt, suicidal ideation, appetite alterations, difficulty to focus and physical agitation or retardation. It is estimated that its worldwide prevalence is 5%, affecting 280-300 million people. A third of patients with depression will develop treatment resistant depression, where symptoms fail to remit after at least two trials of antidepressants. Beyond psychotropics, another treatment option is neuromodulation, where excitatory or inhibitory signals are delivered to the brain, in order to modulate cortical excitability. The tDCS is a non-invasive brain stimulation method that applies a low intensity direct current (1-2mA) directed to the scalp via the cathode and anode electrodes. The current reaches the cortex, facilitating hyperpolarization or depolarization of the axonal membrane potential. Evidence has shown that this method is presented as a technique able to alter cortical and subcortical neural networks. This technique has been used to treat psychiatric disorders such as depression, bipolar affective disorder, panic, hallucinations, obsessive compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, withdrawal, rehabilitation after stroke and pain syndromes such as neuropathic pain, migraine and fibromyalgia. It has a low cost and less side effects than psychotropic medications. In order to be effective, daily repeated sessions of 20-40 minutes are necessary. When applied in a hospital setting, this frequency of sessions can limit its appliance, especially for depressed patients, whose symptoms include fatigue and loss of interest in activities. Furthermore, transportation costs, frequent absences from work and other activities and overload of the healthcare system would also limit its use. Home based devices are portable and easily operated. Thus, it is possible for patients to administer themselves the treatment, in their own home, everyday. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of home-based tDCS in treatment resistant depression patients in long-term treatment.","The main outcome is to estimate the variation of the scores of depressive symptoms, measured through the Hamilton Depression Scale with 17 items. Secondary outcomes include response rates, defined as a reduction of at least 50% in scores, and remission rates, defined as a hamilton score lower than 7. Symptom severity, functionality, quality of life and cognitive impairment secondary to depression will also be measured before and after the interventions, as well as inflammatory blood biomarkers, electroencephalographic activity and cortical excitability measures. Data from the sessions will be downloaded from the devices to check for treatment adherence.

In the first visit, after being informed by the study and its potential risks, all participants who sign a written informed consent form will undergo a screening interview, to confirm the diagnosis of unipolar major depressive episode and exclude active substance use disorder. A sociodemographic questionnaire will also be applied, for the collection of basic data, clinical comorbidities and use of medications. In the second visit, participants who meet the eligibility requirements will be evaluated for baseline levels of depressive and cognitive symptoms, then undergo one run-in session of sham tDCS (placebo) and receive a wrist actometer that must be used during the following two-week period. After this period, in the third visit, depressive symptoms and actigraphy data will be reassessed, and those who did not wear the wrist actometer for at least 7 consecutive days, and those with an improvement of symptoms superior to 30% will not be included in the rest of the trial due to significant response to one session of placebo. Participants who remain eligible will be randomized in a double blind manner (participant and investigator) in a 1:1 ratio to receive 30 sessions of active tDCS (2mA, for 20 minutes, daily, skipping weekends) or 30 sessions of sham tDCS (inactive current, for 20 minutes, daily, skipping weekends). The first session with the randomized device will be performed under supervision of the study researchers, who will teach the participants how to operate the device, and provide a video with instructions to be watched at home if necessary. A psychoeducation video, produced by the research team, will be sent to all the participants after this visit, containing a brief explanation of what depression is and how it's treated. The aim is to provide information with accessible language and ascertain that all the participants understand their diagnosis, and also understand the role of physical activity, healthy diets and basic sleep hygiene have in the improvement of symptoms. During the next three week period, participants will administer themselves the sessions, from monday to friday. The randomized devices will be programmed to administer daily sessions of 20 minutes, from monday to friday, during 6 weeks. All devices will be programmed to not start sessions on weekends, or run more than one session on the same day, unless stimulation is interrupted by some adversity before it has completed at least 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, even if interrupted abruptly, the session will be considered complete. In order to mimic the side effects of the active stimulation, the sham programming delivers 3 ramps of 30 seconds of active current, the first in the first minute of the session, the second after 10 minutes and the third at the last minute of the session. In the fourth visit, participants return after 3 weeks (15 sessions) of stimulation to reassess symptoms and download device and actigraphy data. Participants will return to their homes to administer the following 15 sessions and return after three weeks for the fifth visit, when depressive and cognitive symptoms will be reassessed and participants will be asked if they believe they receive active or sham stimulation. The sixth and last visit takes place 3 months after the end of the trial, for follow up on symptoms and another 15 days of actigraphy for monitoring sleep patterns. Between the third and the fifth visits, weekly online questionnaires will be sent to the participants, for the evaluation and monitoring of adverse effects during the trial. Blood samples, electroencephalograms (EEGs) and cortical excitability measures (assessed through TMS) will be collected twice, in the third and fifth visits (before and after the trial). During the whole trial, online support via whatsapp will be provided. Members of the team will be available for answering questions and doubts that should arise anytime during the treatment.

Multiple studies have shown that REN has high safety, tolerability, and efficacy in adults and adolescents. This study aims to evaluate REN's real-world safety and efficacy in pre-adolescents, 9-11 years old.","The REN device (Nerivio by Theranica, ISRAEL) is a neuromodulation device approved by the FDA for acute and/or preventive treatment of migraine in patients 12 years old and above. It is a wearable device applied to the upper arm. It stimulates C and Aδ noxious fibers using a modulated, symmetrical, biphasic, square pulse with a pulse width of 400 μs, modulated frequency of 100-120 Hz, and up to 40 mA output current which the patient can adjust.

The REN device is operated by a designated smartphone application that is downloaded to the user's phone prior first use of the Nerivio device. As part of the sign-up process for the Nerivio app, all patients accept the terms of use which specify that providing personal information is done on their own free will and that their de-identified data may be used for research purposes. Users are not obligated to provide personal information and could treat without providing any feedback. The app includes a secure, personal migraine diary, which enables patients to record and track their migraines and other headaches. At the beginning of each treatment, and again 2 hours after the start of treatment, patients are prompted to record their symptoms, including the presence or absence of aura, pain level (none, mild, moderate, severe), functional disability (none, mild limitation, moderate limitation, severe limitation), presence of associated symptoms (photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea), and an indication of which medications, if any, were taken within that 2-hour time window.

Post-marketing surveillance is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of REN in larger and more diverse populations than in clinical trials and in various real-world environments and situations. As a digital therapeutic device (i.e., electroceutical), the REN device enables prospective collection of electronic patient-reported outcomes in real-world clinical practice.

The whole system is based on an advanced, ""all in one"" Alerting and Decision Support System that follows patients from the diagnosis and supports the physician in managing the therapy, controlling relevant events impacting on patient safety and activating specific procedures if selected thresholds are exceeded. In the frame of chronic neurological disorders, Medication Overuse Headache (MOH) is a common condition and a major cause of disability.

It is, therefore, a perfect example of a disorder that can benefit from an ICT-assisted approach developing innovative systems and services for monitoring chronic conditions. COMOESTAS goals will be achieved by improving and integrating the traditional paper headache diaries and calendars into an innovative ICT tool taking into account the complex issues that accompany this peculiar form of headache, which will make the patient a key node in the entire process.","It will be a multicentre parallel group study. The two arms of the clinical protocol will be 1) classic approach to MOH and 2) Interactive Electronic Patient Record (IEPR)-based approach to MOH.

Each arm will last 12 months.

A. Headache present on \> 15 days/month.

B. Regular overuse for \> 3 months of one or more acute symptomatic drugs:

1. Ergotamine, triptans, opioids or combination analgesic medications on \> 10 days/month on a regular basis for \> 3 months.
2. Simple analgesics or any combination of ergotamine, triptans, analgesics or opioids on \> 15 days/month on a regular basis for \>3 months without overuse (\> 10 days) of any single class alone.

C. Headache has developed or markedly worsened during medication overuse.

The IEPR approach will be preliminarily tested and validated in small groups of patients during months 6-12 (pilot validation).

Each patient will be evaluated over a period of 7 months.

Classic approach Visit 0: patient is examined and, if suspected to suffer from MOH, is asked to fill in a diary for a month in order to quantify parameters of MOH (days with headache, acute drugs consumed, etc.). Patient has to report that MOH-R criteria were fulfilled for the previous 2 months.

Visit 1: Patient returns to the Centre, diary data are analyzed and recorded, and, if criteria for MOH-R diagnosis are fulfilled and exclusion criteria are ruled out , patient is enrolled in COMOESTAS protocol.

Detoxification: following visit 1, patient undergoes detoxification according to the protocol in Appendix 1. In the subsequent 2 months the patient is instructed to record headache characteristics and consumption of symptomatic drugs on a paper diary.

Visit 2 (2 months after detoxification): patient is visited again; diary is checked; if therapy is successful (patient no longer overuses acute medications for headache) the patient is scheduled for a follow-up visit after 4 months. The patient is asked to keep up recording headache characteristics and consumption of symptomatic drugs on a paper diary for the next 4 months and informed about a telephone contact after 2 months.

Visit 3 (6 months after detoxification): patient is visited again, diary data are collected. Study ends.

IEPR approach Visit 0: patient is examined and, if the minimum data set of the IEPR for MOH is satisfied, the patients is asked to record the headache characteristics as well as acute drugs consumption on a paper diary for a month in order to assess baseline parameters of MOH (days with headache, acute drugs consumed, etc.).

Patient has to report that MOH-R criteria were fulfilled for the previous 2 months.

Visit 1: Patient returns to the Centre, diary data are analyzed and recorded, and, if criteria for MOH diagnosis are confirmed and criteria of exclusion are ruled out, patient is enrolled in COMOESTAS protocol .

Detoxification: following Visit 1, patient undergoes detoxification according to the same protocol adopted for the classic approach.

TBS is a safe, drug-free brain stimulation technique that uses magnets to create electricity and stimulate nerve cells in the brain. After repeated TBS sessions, the increased stimulation of nerve cells can alter the way the brain communicates with itself (by creating new neural pathways) which, in turn, can reduce pain symptoms. Participants in this study will complete a baseline assessment followed by four weeks of daily home headache assessment. Participants will then receive four weeks of TBS administered three times per day and three days per week. After TBS is completed, participants will complete an additional four weeks of daily home headache assessment and return for a one-month follow-up assessment. Participation is expected to last three months.","The primary objective of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of theta burst stimulation (TBS) for the management of post-traumatic headaches to improve outcomes and quality of life for individuals who have suffered a traumatic brain injury (TBI). To improve tolerability and logistical burden, we have developed a novel design whereby participants will receive three doses of TBS on alternate days of the week. This design will allow us to assess efficacy while leveraging an accelerated treatment course (nine stimulation sessions per week). We have three specific aims:

Specific Aim 1. To determine the efficacy and safety of TBS for the treatment of post-traumatic headache among individuals who have sustained a mild TBI. Hypothesis 1a: TBS will be safe, well-tolerated, and reduce the number of headache days. Hypothesis 1b: TBS will improve function and quality of life outcomes.

Specific Aim 2: To determine the efficacy and safety of an accelerated time-course of TBS for the management of post-traumatic headache. Hypothesis 2a: The accelerated-time course will be safe, well-tolerated, and improve quality of life outcomes. Hypothesis 2b: The accelerated time-course will produce greater and faster improvement in headache symptoms than that reported in the literature for standard repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) protocols.

Specific Aim 3: To examine the durability of treatment response to accelerated TBS during a one-month observational period. Hypothesis 3: Accelerated TBS will result in enduring treatment response of post-traumatic headache symptoms over the follow-up period.

This study will be an open-label pilot study and will enroll 20. Participants will complete four weeks of pre-intervention headache assessment via Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). Participants will then receive TBS intervention three times a week for four weeks. TBS will be administered in 10-minute sessions, three times per day with 20 minutes between sessions.

Many patients with CM appear to have associated musculoskeletal neck pain. The purpose of this study is to treat cervicalgia in patients with migraine and to look for improvement in migraine frequency and intensity. Osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) can diagnose and treat common musculoskeletal dysfunction. This may break facilitation within the nervous system and reduce musculoskeletal pain which subsequently will reduce headache frequency. This will be a randomized controlled trail comparing patients with CM treated with OMT vs no treatment. The investigators will look at the frequency of migraine days before and after the treatment period to determine migraine frequency and improvement.","Data will be analyzed by reviewing the amount of headache days during the treatment period

Patients will be distributed randomly into either the treatment arm or control arm. Subjects will be randomized as they are recruited for the study (i.e. subject 1 treatment, subject 2 control, subject 3 treatment, etc.) The participants will be distributed by a research assistant who will allocate the patients randomly to one of the two arms.

Both arms will be diagnosed using tenderpoints (Tenderpoints are small tense edematous areas of tenderness about the size of a fingertip. They are typically located near bony attachments of tendons, ligaments, or in the belly of some muscles).Tenderpoints will be documented and stored in a secure flash drive.

Treatment arm will be treated with an Osteopathic manipulative treatment called counterstrain technique. Osteopathic manipulative treatment is a hands on palpation of the tissues to diagnose and treat neuromusculoskeletal dysfunction. Counterstrain is a passive manipulative technique which the tissue being treated is positioned at a point of balance, or ease, AWAY from the restrictive barrier (The most thought of form of manipulative technique is high velocity low amplitude which is typically performed by chiropractors in spinal manipulation which goes TOWARD the restrictive barrier and actually pass through the restrictive barrier). Once a tenderpoint is found in the muscles the area of treatment is placed in a (three dimensional) position that will eliminate the sensation (tenderness).The treatment position is held for 90 seconds or until a release is felt (release is usually a decrease in the tone or muscle tension).

In the control arm the tenderpoint will Be palpated for 90 seconds with no counterstrain treatment applied. (Risk are possible soreness at palpation site though not likely, there is no benefit) Both treatment and control groups will remain on their current migraine medication regiment.

They will follow-up with Dr. Deborah Reed, MD, FAHS who is a board certified neurologist and headache specialist.

The emergency setting for acute neurological conditions, such as stroke, is peculiar due to time pressure and limited resources for further diagnostics. Clinical skills are essential for swift and accurate bedside diagnosis and thus are the basis for early and correct treatment. This is especially evident in the context of computed tomography being the standard neuroimaging method world-wide with its limitations for detecting smaller infarcts, strokes in the posterior fossa and reduced sensitivity for stroke mimics, such as epileptic seizures or migraine aura. To date, the accuracy of clinical bedside diagnosis of stroke by neurologists verified by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the emergency setting has not been studied in detail. Management of acute stroke patients is a main interest of the neurovascular research group at Inselspital Bern. For example, the investigators analysed the prediction of large vessel occlusion in acute stroke patients by clinical examination and found a significant association of stroke severity measured with the NIHSS score and location of vessel occlusion. Analysis of outcome in stroke patients with mild and rapidly improving symptoms demonstrated that three of four of these patients had a favourable outcome, but those with a central vessel occlusion were likely to deteriorate with poor outcome. These studies showed that there is a correlation of clinical symptoms with the mechanism of stroke, which is important for the outcome after treatment. Importantly, however, the quality of clinical assessment itself is likely highly variable, for example depending on the experience of the treating physician. Factors influencing this clinical assessment, which needs to be done under high temporal and emotional pressure in the emergency setting have not been investigated so far but might be crucial for rapid and successful treatment (""time is brain"").In order to improve clinical diagnosing and future treatment it is essential to quantify the accuracy of clinical diagnosis of stroke in the emergency setting (""how good are neurologists?"") and to assesses whether there are any differences between experienced staff neurologists and junior physicians.

Rationale:

By assessing whether prediction of aetiology of acute neurological deficits is experience-based the investigators aim to understand what symptoms/signs impede the in-experienced from swiftly making the correct diagnosis in the emergency setting. This should help to improve resident training and with this treatment of patients with acute neurological deficits.","OBSERVATIONAL",NA,NA,NA,NA,"CASE_ONLY","PROSPECTIVE",NA,NA,800,"ESTIMATED","Inclusion Criteria:

In this study, the investigators will add another drug called Valproic Acid (VPA) to see whether this makes the treatment better. The addition of Valproic Acid to chemotherapy has been studied in about 65 subjects with cancer and was found to be safe and tolerable. Valproic Acid is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of seizures, mood swings, and migraine headaches. It is not currently approved for cancer, which is why the investigators are conducting this study.

The results of a Phase I study of Valproic Acid and FEC100 in subjects with cancer that has spread has led the investigators to believe that this combination is better than just the standard treatment alone. The investigators are now testing the combination in a study with subjects who have either a large tumor, many lymph nodes involved or patients whose tumor has spread. In addition to the treatment, a main goal of the study is to find out which subjects will benefit from this combination. In the Phase I trial the investigators noticed that while this combination appears to make the chemotherapy more effective, it did not appear to cause more side effects induced by the chemotherapy.","Each year, more than 200,000 patients are diagnosed with breast cancer.

However more recently, neoadjuvant therapy has become more commonly used as it allows the direct assessment of response to systemic therapy and the collection of biological markers of therapy that are otherwise difficult to obtain.

The overarching goal of this study is to investigate potential mechanisms underlying the association between motor activity and mood states and disorders. In a previous study using real-time tracking of objectively assessed motor activity and subjectively rated mood states with ecological momentary assessments (EMA), we found a unidirectional association between motor activity and mood that was especially notable among adults with bipolar I (BPI) disorder. The proposed study seeks to replicate these findings, and more extensively characterize the associations between motor activity and mood states by expanding the assessments of individual, physiologic, cognitive, and environmental correlates. This study will employ an intensive longitudinal design with combined ecological and laboratory assessments in the NIH Clinical Center in a sample of 280 probands with a lifetime history of bipolar I (BPI) disorder, bipolar II (BPII) disorder, major depressive disorder (MDD), or no lifetime history of a mood disorder. The study will also include up to 700 first-degree relatives (280 siblings and 420 offspring) and 280 spouses of the probands. About one-third (35%) of the probands, spouses and offspring will be randomly selected to participate in an inpatient component. The overarching hypothesis is that increases in motor activity, especially exercise, are associated with improvements in mood states. These findings will have implications for interventions in both the general community and clinical samples of people with mood disorders.

Objectives: The study has four specific aims:

1. Examine the associations between motor activity (using high resolution wearable sensors that are time-synchronized with EMA) and mood states in probands with a lifetime history of BPI disorder, BPII disorder, MDD, or no mood disorder (Multidomain Ecological Assessment).
2. Evaluate associations between motor activity and mood states among first-degree relatives and spouses of probands with and without BPI disorder, BPII disorder, MDD, or other mood disorder (Familial Patterns).
3. Quantify the impacts of exercise (a submaximal exercise test) on mood states and related domains by mood-disorder group in a controlled laboratory setting (Exercise).
4. Explore potential correlates of the association between motor activity and mood states (Correlates).

Support for the efficacy of Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and other mindfulness based treatments for chronic pain is building. Recently, research has demonstrated the efficacy of Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) in simultaneously addressing the outcome variables targeted by both CBT and mindfulness based treatment modalities. Although the efficacy of MBCT depression and for other populations has been investigated, there is no extant literature reporting on MBCT for chronic pain. The current application proposes to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of an MBCT protocoll adapted for chronic pain in a series of pilot groups with headache pain patients. We selected headache pain patients for this trial because headache pain is a common complaint in the general population, is the most frequently reported cause of pain in medical practice, and is one of the most disabling conditions for both genders combined. To examine the feasibility of the adapted protocol, the investigators will investigate a number of treatment related outcomes such as recruitment, completion, and drop out rates. Both primary and secondary outcome variables will be investigated to determine treatment efficacy.

This study will provide a research base examining the feasibility and efficacy of MBCT for pain. Results from this study will lay the foundation for future randomized controlled trials comparing MBCT to attention control, and future comparative effectiveness studies of MBCT and CBT.","Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is well established as an efficacious treatment for a wide variety of chronic pain conditions, including headache pain. A promising trend within the behavioral medicine field in recent years has been the integration of mindfulness into traditional treatment modalities and the development of innovative treatments based upon these principles. Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) maintains a patient-centered approach that focuses upon mindfulness meditation as the key mechanism to teach people how to cope with their pain, take better care of themselves, and to improve their overall quality of life. MBSR has successfully been utilized in a number of disorders including chronic pain 1,2,3 and in general medical populations 4 Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT),5 originally developed to target relapse prevention in major depression, is essentially a modification of MBSR to incorporate more traditional cognitive-behavioral interventions into the extant MBSR framework. Studies of MBCT support its efficacy in eliciting cognitive changes similar to those demonstrated in CBT, while still incorporating the more general salutary effects seen in MBSR,6,7,8,9,10While MBCT has been applied to other populations, there has been no published work to date adapting it to chronic pain patients. This is a surprising gap in the literature given the effectiveness of both CBT and mindfulness independently for chronic pain. Therefore, the present proposal seeks to begin to fill these gaps by testing the feasibility and efficacy of MBCT for chronic pain in a series of pilot groups.

Primary Specific Aims The proposed project is a feasibility study designed to test the MBCT protocol for chronic pain treatment and to provide pilot data to support subsequent research proposals to be submitted to the National Institutes of Health. In this initial trial the investigators will use patients with primary complaints of headache pain and treat them at a collaborating headache clinic. We selected this target population because headache pain is highly disabling and is the most common pain related complaint treated in medical practice. Furthermore, given the time frame of the study, it is more feasible to recruit patients where the PI has an established and ongoing collaborative relationship. The proposed project emphasizes the research area of health, medicine, and behavior.

Aim 1: To examine feasibility of the treatment, data will be collected regarding participant flow across each stage of the study design, including recruitment, participation, and drop-out rates, and percentage of sessions attended. Furthermore, pre-treatment expectations, post-treatment satisfaction, and global ratings of self-perceived improvement will be assessed.

Hypotheses: It is expected that the feasibility of MBCT, as measured by the above indicators, will be comparable to similar data for other psychosocial treatments for pain, such as CBT.

Aim 2: As an initial test of the efficacy of MBCT for chronic pain, the investigators will compare an immediate treatment condition to a delayed treatment (OT) control on pre- and post-intervention measures. Time constraints of the current project will necessitate follow-up assessment to be part of future proposals.

Hypotheses: Participants in the immediate treatment condition will obtain significantly greater pre-post treatment gains compared to OT on primary outcome measures of pain acceptance, pain catastrophizing, and pain interference; and secondary outcome measures of mindfulness, pain intensity, perceived disability, selfefficacy, quality of life, and depression.

Long-term objectives: Future projects will include a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing MBCT to an attention control condition (education support group), and eventually a comparative effectiveness stUdy of CBT vs. MBCT.

Innovative aspects of the proposed study: This is the first examination of MBCT for chronic pain, which incorporates specific components of mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapy to form a comprehensive treatment approach.","INTERVENTIONAL","RANDOMIZED","CROSSOVER","TREATMENT",NA,NA,NA,"NONE",NA,32,"ACTUAL","Inclusion Criteria:

PDPH not only increases the misery of the patient, but the length of stay and overall cost of treatment in the hospital also increases. Although the epidural blood patch ( EBP ) is an effective way of treating the problem, the procedure itself could cause another inadvertent dural puncture (DP). Moreover, sometimes patients need to have a second EBP, if the first one is not completely effective. This can be difficult to explain to the patient who has already suffered a lot. Peripheral nerve blocks are well tolerated and effective as adjunctive therapy for many disabling headache disorder.

Sphenopalatine ganglion is a parasympathetic ganglion, located in the pterygopalatine fossa. Transnasal sphenopalatine ganglion block ( SPGB ) has been successfully used to treat chronic conditions such as migraine, cluster headache, and trigeminal neuralgia, and may be a safer alternative to treat PDPH: It is minimally invasive and carried out at the bedside without using imaging. Besides that, it has apparently a faster start than EBP, with better safety profile.

Another minimally invasive peripheral nerve block which has been used quite successful is greater occipital nerve block (GONB). The GONB has been in use for more than a decade to treat complex headache syndromes of varying etiologies like migraine , cluster headache and chronic daily headache with encouraging results. Greater Occipital Nerve (GON) arises from C2-3 segments, its most proximal part lies between obliqua capitis inferior and semispinalis, near the spinous process. Then, GON enters into semispinalis passing through it and after its exit; it enters into trapezius muscle. In distal region of trapezius fascia, it is crossed by the occipital artery and finally the nerve exits the trapezius fascia insertion into the nuchal line about 5-cm lateral to midline. Functionally, GON supplies major rectus capitis posterior muscle, and the skin, muscles, and vessels of the scalp, but is the main sensory supply of occipital region.

Mitrochondria are small organelles inside the cell that are responsible for energy production. Recent studies in animals and humans suggest that abnormalities of mitrochondria may be involved in bipolar depression. The study will also examine whether the food supplement Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) improves mitochondrial function and symptoms such as depressed mood, low energy, anxiety or slowness in thinking and movements in bipolar patients. CoQ10 has been used to increase cell energy production and as an antioxidant. It has had some benefit in patients with Parkinson's disease and migraine and in prolonging survival in patients with cancer and heart failure.

Patients 18-65 years of age with bipolar disorder who are currently in a depressive episode of at least 4 weeks duration may be eligible for this study. The study has four phases, as follows:

Phase I: Medication Withdrawal

Patients taper off all psychotropic medications, usually over 1 to 2 weeks.

Phase II: Baseline Evaluation

After being off all medication for about 2 weeks, patients undergo the following procedures:

* Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). The two procedures are performed in an MRI scanner. Both tests use a strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images that provide information on brain anatomy and chemistry.
* Blood tests to assess mitochondrial function isolated from blood cells.
* Skin biopsy for tests of mitochondria. A small sample of skin tissue 5 x 5 millimeters is surgically removed.

Phase III: Administration of CoQ10 or Placebo

Participants are randomly assigned to take either CoQ10 or placebo (an inactive look-alike substance) twice a day by mouth. While taking the study medication, patients have the following procedures periodically:

* Rating scales for anxiety and depression and adverse events.
* Check of vital signs.
* Blood and urine sample collections.

Phase IV: Study Completion

At the end of the 8 weeks of treatment, patients have a physical examination and electrocardiogram, and the procedures in phase II are repeated. Participants may then receive short-term treatment (up to 12 weeks) with medications for bipolar depression, followed by referred to a community physician for long-term treatment.

...","Bipolar affective disorder is a common, severe, chronic and often life-threatening illness. The depressive phase contributes to the majority of morbidity and mortality in this illness. Impairments in physical and social functioning resulting from depression are often as severe as other chronic medical illnesses. Few of the treatments in use have resulted from an understanding of the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder. Undoubtedly, a greater understanding of the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder will lead to improved treatments.

Current theories of depression suggest that mood disorders are associated with impairments of cellular resilience and structural plasticity possibly a result of abnormal cellular energy metabolism. Studies with Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) in bipolar subjects show reduced brain intracellular pH and reduced ATP. Cellular energy generated by mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation from glucose via the electron transport chain is stored as ATP, which provide neurons and glia with energy required to maintain their function. Mitochondrial dysfunction and its inability to compensate for increase in ATP demand might lead to impaired cellular resilience believed to be involved in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder. Abnormal regulation of nuclear genes coding for mitochondrial proteins in the hippocampus of bipolar subjects provides further evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in bipolar disorder.

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an essential cofactor in the mitochondrial electron transport chain necessary for cellular energy generation. Exogenous administration of CoQ10 attenuates ATP depletion and has anti-oxidant properties. In light of the above evidence, we hypothesize that bipolar disorder is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction as evidenced by impaired brain energy metabolism and that administration of CoQ10, a mitochondrial enhancer, will restore mitochondrial function. To accomplish these objectives, we will compare mitochondrial functions in bipolar depressed subjects to 26 healthy controls matched for age, gender and BMI. Measures of mitochondrial function will include brain lactate levels (a product of anaerobic glycolysis) with H+ MRS, 2) assays of mitochondrial function in cultured fibroblasts and platelets, and 3) gene expression of mitochondrial and nuclear genes using a cDNA Microarray. Further, subjects with bipolar depression, ages 18 to 65 will be randomized to either CoQ10 (300-1200 mg/day) or placebo in a double-blind placebo controlled trial for a period of 8 weeks. Measures of mitochondrial function will be compared between subjects randomized to placebo or CoQ10 at baseline and at the end of the 8-week trial.","INTERVENTIONAL","RANDOMIZED","PARALLEL",NA,NA,NA,NA,"QUADRUPLE",NA,0,"ACTUAL","* INCLUSION CRITERIA:

We propose a study whereby patients who are referred for polysomnography (PSG, or ""sleep study"") are consented, then surveyed on the presence or absence of headache. A brief questionnaire is followed up with a more detailed questionnaire to characterize whether this headache that the patient has is truly a headache disorder. Following the survey and PSG, the patient's sleep study parameters are evaluated to see whether there are certain correlations between what has been recorded and the particular headache disorder present.

Lastly, if the patient was diagnosed with OSA and fitted with a CPAP device, the patient will be queried several weeks later to evaluate whether there was improvement or cessation of the headache disorder.","There is a well-documented but poorly understood relationship between headache disorders (e.g. migraine, cluster headaches, awakening headaches, etc.) and sleep disorders. The exact prevalence of patients with concomitant headache disorder and sleep disorder is not even known. Hypotheses surrounding the relationship include low overnight oxygen saturation and/or hypercarbia in the case of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with awakening headache, primary headache disorder as a contributor to secondary sleep disorder, atypical lengths or percentages of time in various sleep stages resulting in disordered sleep patterns and subsequent headache, bruxism causing tension type headaches, among others. Our review of the literature shows there has not yet been a prospective trial evaluating headache disorders and concomitant sleep disorders with attempts to find vagaries or abnormalities in terms of sleep parameters as a way to explain headache disorder.

Additionally, although there have been few retrospective reviews of small numbers of patients examining an intervention (in this case, the addition of continuous positive airway pressure - CPAP) as a means to correct a sleep disorder with a subsequent evaluation of the patient's pre-existing headache disorders, there has yet to be a prospective trial evaluating same. Our team identified at least one retrospective study that would suggest that treating OSA with standard of care CPAP improved pre-existing symptoms of headache.

Our study proposes to - after obtaining consent - survey patients with suspected sleep disorders who have been scheduled for a sleep study to evaluate the overall prevalence of headache disorder among this particular population. We would then evaluate various standard sleep study parameters such as lowest oxygen saturation, time in various sleep stages, sleep latency, total sleep time, respiratory disturbance index, presence of bruxism, and so on, to see whether there is a correlation between certain of these parameters and a particular headache disorder. We also would survey those patients diagnosed with OSA following institution of CPAP to see whether there was a decrement or cessation in headache frequency or intensity.

Being that a significant proportion of our patients are returning war veterans with possible traumatic brain injuries or post-traumatic stress disorder, we would also query patients regarding the presence of these disorders. These data would be taken into account as a sub-analysis of the overall data set.

The study will be of 12 months duration. Over 2000 sleep studies are performed at our institution in 12 months. We anticipate an enrollment of between 400 to 800 subjects.","OBSERVATIONAL",NA,NA,NA,NA,"DEFINED_POPULATION","PROSPECTIVE",NA,NA,600,"ESTIMATED","Inclusion Criteria:

Although disturbed cervical alignment has been determined in tension headache and migraine, there are few studies with controversial results in the literature investigating the effects of the change in cervical lordosis on CEH.

The StimRelieve Halo System utilizes a minimally invasive procedure to implant a neurostimulator. This technology includes an octopolar electrode array stimulator with an embedded receiver. The energy source is a small, external, rechargeable transmitter, which is worn by the patient. The StimRelieve Halo System eliminates the implantable pulse generator, which has been the most common reason for reoperation or discomfort with existing devices.

For this study, all subjects will be randomized at enrollment into either a delayed or immediate continuation group. The immediate continuation group will immediately continue with the stimulation therapy after the 30-day trial period and will be monitored for a total of 12 months. The delayed activation group will have their device turned off after the 30-day trial period for the next 3-months. At the 3-month visit, both groups be evaluated and the delayed activation group will have their devices reactivated.

All subjects will immediately receive the permanent stimulator(s). The permanent stimulators can easily be removed if non-responders are identified. The wireless technology eliminates the need for externalized extensions, IPG's and thus reoperation. Additionally the outcome is highly dependent on placement of the stimulators. By eliminating the need for a staged trial, infection rates and incidence of pocket pain will decrease.

We chose to test its effects on epilepsy because epilepsy and migraine have common features so, are often treated with common drugs.","Goals:

The purpose of this study is to determine whether BOTOX injections into the scalp raise seizure threshold such that focal seizures are less likely to occur, and less likely to generalize.

Objectives:

1. To test whether scalp BOTOX injections mitigate seizure frequency or seizure severity. This objective will be tested using a prospective clinical observation in patients with focal epilepsy (see definitions below)
2. To test whether quantitative measures of seizures susceptibility (cortical excitability) are altered by scalp BOTOX injections. This objective will be tested using 24-hour ambulatory scalp EEG recording and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with simultaneous EEG/EMG a noninvasive tool to measure cortical excitability (Tsuboyama et al 2019).

Clarification of terminology:

* Focal seizures are seizures that arise in one area of the brain.
* Focal seizures with impaired awareness are seizures that arise in one area of the brain, and often spread to areas associated with conscious experience (i.e., are associated with alteration of awareness).
* Focal to bilateral tonic clonic seizures are seizures that arise in one brain region and spread to the entire forebrain, bilaterally and manifest as a convulsion.
* Primary generalized seizures are seizure that arise simultaneously in both hemispheres.

Overall Study Design:

In a single-center open-label study, patients with pharmaco-resistant focal epilepsy will undergo 8-week seizure monitoring and baseline 24-hour ambulatory EEG and TMS-EEG-EMG. This period will take place between day 1 and day 59 (see flowchart). Each patient will then be injected with BOTOX (145 units) according to the FDA-approved paradigm for the treatment of migraine, plus injections along the sagittal suture. Seizure diary will be maintained for the duration of the study. EEG and TMS-EEG-EMG will be repeated 21 days, when BOTOX effects usually begin, and 8 weeks after injection, when BOTOX effect are usually at their peak. Data will then be analyzed to measure BOTOX antiepileptic capacity.

Screening and Enrollment Period (1 in-person visit):

Participants will initially be screened in person and written consent will be obtained. Screening will include a review of medical, surgical and seizure history and current medication review. They will be provided instruction on maintaining a daily seizure diary for 8 weeks in order to capture their baseline seizure frequency. If frequency is less than an average of 3 seizures/month or if there is a change in their seizure medication, the participant will be excluded at that time. Due to variability in seizure frequency, the baseline seizure monitoring period may be extended up to an additional 4 weeks.

Baseline and Follow-up EEG and TMS with EEG Assessments (2 visits at each time point - 6 total visits):

Once the participant is fully screened, they will come to BIDMC to be set up with a 24 hour ambulatory EEG. A second study visit will include the TMS with EEG testing (details provided below in ""Procedures""). If a participant screens out of being TMS eligible, the participant will still be included and this visit will not occur. These assessments will be repeated 21 and 56 days (+/- 5 days) after the Botox injection. Neuro QOL questionnaires will be completed at baseline, 56 weeks after Botox and the final visit.

PROCEDURES:

-Botulinum A toxin injection: Will follow the FDA-approved guideline of the treatment of chronic migraine. The following modifications are planned: (a) Total units 145 instead of 155. (b) Number of injection sites 29 instead of 31. (c) the 6 injection sites in the trapezius muscle will be eliminated as they are irrelevant to our attempt to reduce seizure events. Instead, 4 injections will be made subcutaneously along the superior sagittal suture (see figures below), where no muscles exist and thus no muscle weakness is likely. This dose (145 Units) is well below the FDA-approved guideline on safety for adolescents and adults (no more than 10 Units/Kg or a total of 340 Units).

Botox injections will take place in the BIDMC Headache Clinic which is a part of the Arnold Pain center at 1 Brookline Place. Injections will be administered by Dr. Sait Ashina, the Director of the Headache Clinic.

EEG: 24-hour ambulatory EEG with 10-20 international system of electrode placement will be obtained at three time points: (1) 1-4 weeks prior to BOTOX injections, (2) 21 days/3 weeks (+/- 5 days) after BOTOX injections, (3) 56 days/8-weeks (+/- 5 days) after BOTOX injection.

TMS: TMS-derived metrics will be obtained at the same three time points as EEG: (1) 1-4 weeks prior to BOTOX injections, (2) 21 days/3 weeks (+/- 5 days) after BOTOX injections, (3) 56 days/8-weeks (+/- 5 days) after BOTOX injection. TMS is a safe, non-invasive method of focal cortical stimulation used to measure the cortical excitation/inhibition (E:I) ratio. A magnetic field is generated by a powerful extracranial magnet that induces intracranial electrical currents over the focal region of stimulation. When coupled with surface EMG electrodes (TMS-EMG), output resultant from stimulation over the motor cortex can be measured as a motor evoked potential (MEP) from a target muscle (most often the abductor pollicis brevis, APB).

All TMS-EMG-EEG sessions will be identical. Subjects will be set up in a chair with an EEG cap and with EMG electrodes placed on both hands for collection of MEPs during stimulation over the bilateral motor cortices (M1). The EEG cap and electromyography (EMG) electrodes will remain in place throughout the TMS session. The session will include resting-state EEG measurements; determination of motor threshold and input-output curve, cortical silent period, single pulse and paired pulse TMS-EEG in up to 8 brain regions (left and right frontal lobes, left and right motor cortex, left and right parietal lobes, and left and right occipital lobes). Each subject will undergo sham stimulation to control for nonspecific effects, such as the auditory evoked potential. The total time of the session will be approximately 4-5 hours.

Seizure Tracking:

All subjects and families will utilize a digital seizure diary (seizuretracker.com), but with the option to use paper diaries instead if they prefer. Proficiency in seizure diary maintenance will be confirmed by study staff during the screening period. Study staff may call the participant to remind them to complete their diary entries and/or to re-educate the participant regarding maintaining the diary. Seizure documentation (frequency, severity, gross description) will be maintained for 8 weeks before and 12 weeks after BOTOX injections.

If participants choose to use the digitial seizure diary, they will be asked to share their information with the study team via the Valet system, by printing reports from SeizureTracker or by visually and verbally (via phone call check-ins) sharing the information that they have documented in their diary, just as they would if they choose to keep a paper diary. It is not possible to download data from the Valet system - the study team will write down and/or direct enter into REDCap the details that the participant shares regarding their diary. Of note, is that SeizureTracker is a very common App that patients with epilepsy routinely use and are familiar with. Participants who choose to join seizuretracker to maintain their diary for the study will be advised to not utilize the Alexa feature and will be instructed to carefully review the features that they can opt out of along with the Terms and Conditions for users. There are participants who may already use seizuretracker prior to engaging in the study, therefore, they will already have made their personal choices regarding use of the program. Lastly, participants will ahv the option of continuing or closing their account at the end of the study.

Study staff will check the seizure diary weekly to make note of frequency as compared to baseline. If a participant has an increase in seizure frequency at or above 100% from baseline over 4 weeks, the study MD will review the seizure tracking and diary, talk with the participant and, per the clinician judgement, may refer the participant to their provider for follow-up. The 4 week time frame is to account for a patient population that has frequent seizures and can experience clusters of seizures and/or can have stressful conditions/triggers that may temporarily increase seizure frequency. In addition, the study team (including the study MD/epileptologist) will review the seizure frequency/diary of all post-Botox injection participants on a weekly basis to identify if a participant is trending in this direction so that the study MD can make a judgement if there is a clinical concern/need to further review the participant's status at any point.

Neuro-QOL:

Participants will be asked to complete components of the standardized Neuro Quality of Life assessment, a self- report tool used to measure health related quality of life in a wide range of neurologic disorders. Participants are asked to score their responses to prompts on a scale of 1-5. The following components will be used in this study (copies of the scales are attached): Ability to Participate in Social Roles, Anxiety , Depression, Emotional and Behavioral Dyscontrol, Fatigue, Positive Affect and Well-Being, Stigma, Satisfaction with Social Roles and Activities, and Cognitive Function.","INTERVENTIONAL","NA","SINGLE_GROUP","TREATMENT",NA,NA,NA,"NONE",NA,25,"ESTIMATED","Patients with focal drug-resistant epilepsy (see inclusion and exclusion criteria).

It investigates the consequences of the activity of genes and proteins. One of its advantages is that it is able to do a simultaneous measurement of metabolic changes in living organisms as a response to a disturbance (disease, diet, environment, others) and because a metabolic profile is summative of all the biochemical processes occurring in the body at a given time, it makes no presumption about the relative importance of these processes. Ultimately it is a fingerprint of the organism's health status, at a given time.

Metabolomic analysis of serum, plasma and urine has revealed panels of metabolites that distinguish patients with cardiovascular disease, breast cancer, Parkinson disease, Alzheimer's disease and diabetes from control patients. Regarding ocular diseases only few studies have been published, related to diabetic retinopathy, retinal detachment, age-related macular degeneration, uveitis and glaucoma.

Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness in the world, according to the World Health Organization, and there are still no biomarkers that can provide an early diagnosis. Nowadays, glaucoma classification relies substantially in the measurement of intraocular pressure (IOP), which can be rather artificial and also unreliable since IOP values can fluctuate during the day. Moreover, patients with normal IOP values can also develop glaucomatous neuropathy (normal-tension glaucoma, NTG) and progress even when IOP is decreased. Several studies have shown that NTG patients suffer from a systemic vascular dysregulation, with higher rates of systemic hypotension, Raynaud phenomenon and migraine. Hence, other mechanisms than an increased IOP are of importance in the development and progression of glaucoma.

Only one metabolome-wide study has been made in glaucoma (Burgess, I.; 2015). In a sample of 72 american patients with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), the authors found significant differences in comparison to controls.

The hypothesis for this study is that glaucoma patients will differ from controls, and POAG patients will differ from NTG patients. The investigators will look into metabolomics as a way to create a method to diagnose and stratify patients, as an add-on or alternative to the currently available diagnostic tools like IOP, functional and structural measurement.","This is a cross sectional study built to compare samples from glaucoma patients undergoing surgery (open-angle glaucoma and normal-tension glaucoma, age and gender matched) with age and gender-matched controls (healthy patients undergoing cataract surgery).

Observational study on response predictors and tolerability of Candesartan in usual clinical practice

INTRODUCTION:

Migraine is a neurological disease with a prevalence of 14% of the population 1, 2. It is the second most disabling disease in terms of years of life lived with disability, especially in the age group between 15 and 49 years3. Migraine is also the headache the most frequently seen in neurology consultations and headache units4.

Since the 1970s, numerous preventive drugs have been developed. One of the problems is that many of these drugs come from other indications, such as depression, epilepsy or hypertension5. Nowadays, clinical practice guidelines base the indication mainly on the level of evidence6, which, given the age and scarcity of these studies, is limited. Although the new drugs are based on clinical trials according to the current methodology, they are unlikely to be indicated in patients who have not tried any preventive treatment.

Candesartan is an angiotensin-2 receptor antagonist drug that has shown efficacy in episodic migraine mainly in two clinical trials compared to placebo, using a 16 mg daily dose. The first study showed a monthly headache days reduction of 4.9 days of (standard deviation 10.6) in episodic migraine patients that had previously failed to none or one preventive, with 2-6 episodes of headache per month at baseline7. The second study had three arms, including propranolol and placebo showing a montly headache days reduction of -2.91 days (standard deviation 1.06) and showing no-inferiority with respect to propranolol8.

Spanish official headache guidelines recommend Candesartan use in patients with migraine with and without aura, particularly if they have hypertension or comorbid depression6. In some international prestige centers, it is the first choice drug. In habitual clinical practice, one aspect that limits its use is tolerability, being frequent the presence of hypotension and dizziness, even at the dose of 8mg, frequently used in our environment9. In the studies carried out, there were adverse effects in 45-50% of the patients and in 10% of patients was a reason for treatment discontinuation 7, 8.

The aim of our study is to evaluate which clinical factors are associated with a better therapeutic response or a worse tolerability in usual clinical practice.

Hypothesis The therapeutic response and tolerability to candesartan may be influenced by individual factors or related to the evolution of migraine.

PATIENTS AND METHODS:

Design:

Multicentric, prospective, observational, descriptive, open, study of the response and tolerability predictors of candesartan in migraine patients.

Eligibility:

Inclusion criteria:

Diagnosis of migraine (episodic or chronic) according to the International Classification of headache Disorders (ICHD), 3rd version, criteria10.

Being treated with Candesartan under the criteria of the physician and according to local guidelines.

Age \>18 years. More than 4 days of headache per month in the preceding 3 months. More than 1 year of migraine evolution. Beginning of migraine before the age of 50. Ability to provide informed consent.

Exclusion criteria:

Previous failure of three or more preventive drugs in accordance with the definition provided below.

Concomitant use of another preventive drug or use of it in less than 5-half lives of the drug.

History of another active primary headache with a periodicity considered frequent according to the International Classification of Headache disorders, that is, more than 10 days per month at the time of screening or the basal period.

Continuous or daily headache in the month prior to inclusion in the study. Pregnancy or breastfeeding. Any relevant cardiovascular conditions. Kidney diseases. Hyperkaliemia. Use of another concomitant preventive. Previous use of candesartan. Current use of another Angiotensin Conversing Enzime Inhibitor or Angiotensin-II receptor antagonist.

Alcoholism or drug use.

Concomitant treatment:

The study will not interfere in the current practice, participants will receive the candesartan in the same manner and intensity if they were not enrolled in the study.

Patients will be allowed to use their usual symptomatic treatment as usual. The number of days of symptomatic treatment and the number of use of triptans will be reflected.

The concomitant drugs with potential use as a preventive according to National Clinical Practice guidelines (gabapentin, pregabalin, tricyclic antidepressants, duloxetine, valproic acid, phenytoin, lamotrigine, topiramate, botulinum toxin, anti-CGRP antibodies, beta-blockers, lisinopril) will not be permitted.

Treatment failure shall be defined as insufficient efficacy at a sufficient dose and for an adequate duration or withdrawal due to adverse effects of a drug present in the national headache guidelines.

Intervention and visits:

The visits will be carried out in the Headache Units of the participating centers. At the baseline visit, investigators will review that patients meet all inclusion criteria and none exclusion criteria. In accordance with the Good Clinical Practice guidelines12, a clear explanation will be given of the objective of the study, the role of the participant and the complete absence of risks that the study pose, due to the observational nature. The participant will be provided with a contact telephone number where he or she can contact in the event of an incident that want to refer to the investigators. The informed consent will be signed and a copy given to the participant.

During the initial visit, the monthly headache days at baseline will be gathered, including the number of days of intense pain, the number of days of taking symptomatic medication, the number of days of taking triptans and the number of visits to the emergency department. A number of demographic and clinical variables (described below) will be reviewed. The patient will be asked to make a prospective record of his or her days of headache as well as the intensity of headache and the use of medication in a standardized diary (appendix) for thirty-six weeks. The presence of possible adverse effects will be detailed. The patient will be evaluated and both basal blood pressure and heart rate will be measured. Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Allodynia Symptom Checklist (ASC-12) scales will be administered.

Administration of candesartan:

Participants will receive candesartan in the same manner and intensity as if they would not be enrolled in the study, according to the Spanish national guidelines.

A follow up visit will be done at week 12 to analyze response to candesartan and the possibility of adverse effects. Physicians will modify candesartan dose according to their criteria and the local guidelines. Treatment response will be analyzed during the third visit, at week 24.

Study variables:

Demographic variables:

Sex, current age, age of onset, type of migraine (episodic/chronic), months of evolution of chronic migraine, weight, height, overweight (determined according to the CUN-BAE scale).

STUDY DESIGN

Sample size:

For calculation of sample size we used the combined data from both studies, in which, through analysis by intention to treat, the 50% response rate in the group treated with candesartan was 18/57 and 24/66, for a combined response rate of 42/123=34.1%. In the placebo group the 50% response rate in the placebo group was 1/57 and 14/64, for a combined ratio of 15/121=12.4%.

Randomization:

This is an open, not controlled with placebo study.

Stratification:

There will be no stratification of patients. Regression analysis will be performed to evaluate factors associated with better response or worse tolerability.

Statistical aspects:

An anonymous database will be created in which the identity of the patient will be dissociated from the rest of the data. SPSS statistics package will be used for statistical analysis. Analyses will be performed both by intention to treat and per protocol, the primary objective being determined by intention to treat.

The main variable will be calculated by evaluating percentage of patients in whom the number of headache days per month, evaluated between weeks 20-24, is at least 50% lower than the number of headache days per month in the baseline period, before the use of candesartan.

Logistic regression analysis and linear regression will be performed depending on the type of variable and those associated variables with a value of p\<0.05 will be selected. In addition, a multivariate regression analysis will be carried out in which all variables with a p\<0.015 will be included and a second analysis will be carried out in which the number of days of reduction with respect to the baseline situation between weeks 20 and 24 will be used as a variant.

Factors associated with the presence of adverse effects will be analyzed by logistic or linear regression analysis. 30%, 75% and 100% response rate analysis will also be performed.

To evaluate the reduction in days of pain, the mean number of days of pain between weeks 20-24 and the baseline period will be compared. It will be evaluated if the distribution is normal using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and if appropriate, the Student t test will be performed for paired samples; using the Mann-Whitney U test in case the distribution is not normal. The analysis will be repeated for the period between weeks 8-12 and weeks 32-36. The same analysis will also be done to determine the change in the average number of days of severe pain and days of use of symptomatic medication. The mean score on the HIT-6 and HADS scales over the same periods and the change in heart rate and blood pressure will also be compared. The Bonferroni method will be used to correct for multiple comparisons. In the comparison of qualitative variables, the Chi-square test or the exact Fisher test in non-parametric variables will be used. An intermediate analysis will be carried out when 50% of the patients have been recruited.

The management of lost data will be done by imputation in a worse-case scenario. Missing days will be considered days with pain and treatment.

Ethical and legal aspects:

Eligible patients will be exposed to the possibility of participating in the study and if they accept, they will be explained in detail the objective, the procedure and what their participation consists of. If they accept, they must sign an informed consent12. In the event of refusing participation or revoking consent, patients may continue their usual treatment and care process without any modification or conditions. They will be free to refuse to participate in the study or to suspend their collaboration whenever they wish, with no impact on their future medical care.

In adult patients with stroke and normal carotid arteries, ASA is an important predictor of recurrent stroke. The most common abnormalities associated are interatrial shunts, that is, a patent foramen ovale (PFO) or an atrial septal defect (ASD). For large ASA with interatrial shunt, it is difficult to cover ASA with conventional devices, which might result in unstability of occluders and related complications . For isolated ASA with high risk, thrombus and emboli have been reported and anticoagulation has been used empirically.

In addition, the left atrial septal pouch can be considered as a special subtype of atrial septal aneurysm, in which thrombus might arise from the cavity of the pouch. Pervious researches have noted that left atrial septal pouch was a site of origin of thrombus formation and a source of embolism, and it was associated with cryptogenic stroke. For patients with ASA, we hypothesizes that transcatheter reconstruction of atrial septum might be achieved with PFO occluder through transseptal perforation. The aim of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of transcatheter exclusion of ASA via transseptal perforation.

This study will enroll subjects with ASA (including left atrial septal pouch), and enrollment will be divided into three phases.

There is a need for effective, low-cost non-pharmacological strategies to reduce migraine load in migraineurs (based on International Headache Society classification International Classification of Headache Disorders \[ICHD\]-3; experience headache \[migraine-like or tension-type-like\] on 15+ days/month for 3+ months, and have migraine headaches \[either with aura or without aura\] on 8+ days/month). This represents an area of interest, as common migraine medications induce central nervous system side-effects including aphasia, ataxia, somnolescence, and vertigo; and 79% of suffers have an interest in trying novel treatment strategies with lower adverse effects than medications.

Exercise has been shown to be a non-pharmacological intervention to reduce migraine burden. However, how environmental (i.e. - time-of-day, exposure to nature) and genetic factors (i.e. - polymorphisms in circadian and migraine associated genes) impact the laudatory effects of exercise remains unknown. There are independently established heritable components to migraine frequency (65%), circadian rhythm (70%), and aerobic power during exercise (66%). Thus, the central hypothesis is that an optimal environment can improve the exercise-induced reduction in migraine load, which is influenced by genetic heritability of migraine related gene polymorphisms.","Willing participants who are self-reported chronic migraineurs will complete an informed consent followed by a health risk questionnaire to determine study eligibility.

Phase I: Chronic migraineurs will be screened using the Morningness/Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) to recruit a cohort of discrepant chronotypes (Definite Morning, Morning; and Evening, Definite Evening). Resulting participants will be complete a baseline migraine load evaluation and assigned to four weeks of moderate intensity exercise (60-70% estimated heart rate max, 2 x per week, 30-min/session) consolidated to either the morning (before 09:00) or afternoon (after 17:00) in a randomized cross-over design. Intensity will be tracked through a heart rate monitor that will be provided to participants, and an application that they can download to their phone. Participants will be able to keep the heart rate monitor upon completion of the study. An example of potential exercises will be provided to participants and research team members will check in every 1-2 weeks to see how exercise is progressing. Migraine burden will be assessed pre- and post-training after each condition using the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) and the short version of the Headache Impact Test (HIT-6). Half of the participants will exercise for one month during a time of day that is in sync with their chronotype (i.e. Morning type person will exercise in the morning), and the other half of the participants will exercise at a time of day that is not in sync (i.e. Morning type person will exercise in the evening). There will be a one-month wash out period, and then participants will complete training at the other time of day. A buccal swab will be obtained (according to protocols outlined on our approved Institutional Biosafety Committee protocol) for phenotyping of genes specific to chronotype and migraine.

Phase II will also recruit chronic ICHD-3 migraineurs. Participants will complete a baseline migraine load evaluation as described above. If an effect of chronotype is found in Phase I, participants will complete exercise training in sync with their chronotype. Participants will be randomly assigned to four weeks of moderate intensity aerobic exercise (60-70% estimated heart rate max, 2 x per week, 30-min/session) in either natural or indoor environments in a randomized cross-over design. Intensity will be tracked through a heart rate monitor that will be provided to participants, and an application that they can download to their phone. Participants will be able to keep the heart rate monitor upon completion of the study. An example of potential exercises will be provided to participants and research team members will check in every 1-2 weeks to see how exercise is progressing. A recent investigation provided evidence that activity performed in a desert environment provided the same benefits as in a green landscape with respect to both cardiovascular measures as well as perception of comfort, calm, and perceived stress. Half of the participants will exercise for one month in a natural environment that they select (outdoors in a park, or trail) and the other half will complete exercise indoors (participants will not require access to fitness facilities, although these could be used if they are already a member). There will be a one month wash out period, and then participants will complete exercise training in the other setting. Change in the monthly migraine load will be determined between environments. A buccal swab will be obtained for phenotyping of genes specific to chronotype and migraine.

Buccal swab samples will be used to isolate DNA. Isolated DNA will be genotyped at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) Genomics Core Facility using polymerase chain reaction and then disposed of. Genotypes will be linked to participant migraine load responses, and then reported in aggregate.

The investigators plan to maintain regular contact with participants.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of BoNT-A in reducing the number of migraine days in a population of migraineurs with a high frequency of migraine attacks over a 12-month period.","Episodic migraine (EM) is a common type of disabling headache that affects up to 15% of the general population. In a minority of patients, migraine progressively increase in frequency, until it becomes chronic. According to the criteria of the International Headache Society chronic migraine (CM) is characterized by a headache that is present on at least 15 days per month over at least three months period, with migraine characteristics on at least 8 days/month. Population studies estimate that patients who have episodic migraine transition to chronic migraine at a rate of about 2.5% per year.

CM is a devastating disorder associated to severe disability. Patients with CM frequently overuse symptomatic medications in the attempt to control their disease, which adds up to the high costs associated to the disorder In this frame, it seems of the outmost importance to strive at preventing the transition from EM to CM.

Transition to CM rarely is a rapid phenomenon. Most often it occurs over several months or years during which the frequency of attacks progressively increases as does the intake of acute medications. High monthly headache frequency is a risk factor for the progression of episodic migraine to chronic migraine. Compelling evidence from clinical and pre-clinical studies suggests that the transformation into CM is associated to, and probably brought about by, plastic changes in the peripheral and central nervous system induced by the repetitive occurrence of pain attacks. These changes configure a condition of chronic sensitization, usually associated to a reduced response to treatments.

In this frame, it is noteworthy that the investigators previously showed that patients with CM overusing acute medications bear a condition of enhanced facilitation of spinal cord pain processing that is detectable with specific neurophysiological evaluations. The situation normalizes, i.e. pain facilitation is reduced, 60 days after successful treatment. Similarly, the Danish group showed that patients with chronic headache associated to medication overuse (most of whom were suffering from CM) are sensitized to pain, and pain perception continues to normalise over a period of at least 12 months when patients are successfully treated.

At the moment Onabotulinum toxin A (BoNT-A) represents the only drug specifically approved for CM prophylaxis.

Seven different subtypes of botulinum toxin (A-G) are known. A highly-diluted preparation of botulinum toxin type A was introduced in clinical practice in the 1970s and 1980s to treat squint and blepharospasm. Since then, it has found uses in other areas of medicine including dystonia (including writer's cramp), post-stroke spasticity, and hyperhidrosis but in the mid-1990s a number of people reported improvement in headaches in patients receiving botulinum toxin for other reasons. Finally, in the first decade of 2000 two trials, the Phase 3 Research Evaluating Migraine Prophylaxis Therapy (PREEMPT) recruited 1384 patients with chronic migraine, and randomised them to treatment with BoNT-A (Botox® by Allergan Industries) or placebo. These patients were suffering on average 20 days of headache each month, of which 18 were moderate or severe. Those randomised to Botox®® received fixed-site, fixed dose injections every 12 weeks over 56 weeks. These injections covered seven specific areas of the head and neck, with a total dose of between 155-195 units. At six months, after two cycles of treatment, those treated with Botox® had on average eight less days of headache each month. After 12 months, 70% of those treated had ≤50% the number of headaches that they had done originally. Botox® was well-tolerated, the commonest side effects being neck pain (6.7%), muscular weakness (5.5%), and drooping of the eyelid (3.3%). No serious irreversible side effects have ever been reported in trials of Botox® in headache.

These studies led in 2013 to the approval by AIFA of Botox® as a drug form CM prophylaxis.

An increasing body of evidence suggests that BoNT-A acts on peripheral trigeminal endings by inhibiting the release of nociceptive neuropeptides - such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) - and glutamate, as well as the expression of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1, thereby reducing directly peripheral sensitization, and, indirectly, central sensitization. It is noteworthy that preclinical data also suggest a central antinociceptive action for BoNT-A, probably associated with an enhanced opioidergic and GABA-ergic transmission.

Taken together, these observations provide the rationale of this study, which is to evaluate whether BoNT-A treatment is effective in reducing the number of migraine days in migraineurs with a high monthly frequency of migraine attacks.

This study is a phase II, single group, non-randomized, non-controlled, open label trial performed at a single centre: Mondino Foundation.

Patients affected by migraine with high frequency of attacks per month were enrolled at the Headache Science Centre of IRCCS C. Mondino in Pavia. After the screening visit, selected patients were evaluated with a headache daily diary for a period of 1 month. If the diagnosis of episodic migraine with high frequency of attacks per month was confirmed, the patient were enrolled and received the treatment with BoNT-A at the centre every 3 months for 4 cycles (at visit V2-V5-V8-V11). At the first administration of the treatment (V2), 155 UI of Botox were injected according to the approved PREEMPT protocol, in 31 sites. From visit 5, the PREEMPT 'follow-the-pain' paradigm will be applied in patients falling in the 'non-responder' or 'partial responder' classes after the 1st BoNT-A injection, with the possibility to increase the doses up to 195 UI in maximum 39 sites.

Every 3 month the patients were asked to fill in 3 validated questionnaires for the quantification of disability (Migraine Disability Assessment Score Questionnaire - MIDAS), quality of life (Mental Status Questionnaire - MSQ), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale - HADS). Every month the patient also received a phone call from the site personnel in order to be updated on the clinical conditions.

We propose to study the feasibility and safety of tDCS alongside physiotherapy for CGH further in a randomized sham controlled trial.","Annually, up to 150,000 people in Canada and experience cervicogenic headaches (CGH) with many of these patients suffering from chronic CGH. CGH is a pain disorder where pain is perceived in the head but caused by dysfunction of the cervical spine and its anatomical structure. More specifically, the pathogenesis of CGH is due to the convergence of nociceptive afferents from the upper three cervical nerves and trigeminal nerves onto second-order neurons in the trigeminocervical nucleus. The pain signaling resulting from this is also modulated through sensorineural pathways involving the thalamus and the sensorimotor cortex. As such symptoms of CGH include restricted movement, local tenderness of the upper cervical spine joints, musculoskeletal impairments, headache, local pressure hyperalgesia and bilateral thermal hypoesthesia. To date, there is no ""cure"" for chronic CGH and current treatment entails trial and error with behavior management, environmental modifications and medications. Consequently, there is a significant need for new approaches to symptom management in order to help improve functional impairment and disease burden associated with treating CGH. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and physiotherapy have a high degree of safety and have been studied as an intervention for many other chronic pain conditions and headache disorders, including arthritis and migraines, demonstrating considerable potential. The investigators propose to study the safety and feasibility of tDCS alongside physiotherapy as a treatment for CGH in a randomized sham controlled trial.

RESEARCH QUESTIONS AND OBJECTIVES

The overall objective is to study the feasibility and safety of tDCS applied to the primary motor cortex in patients with CGH and to explore whether active tDCS augments the effect of rehabilitation therapy.

Specifically the objectives are:

Primary Objective: To determine whether active tDCS is feasible and safe compared to sham when administered with rehabilitation therapy for patients with CGH when administered 3 times per week over the course of 6 weeks; this will be measured with patient drop out rates, medication use, and adverse effects throughout the treatment process and at 6- and 12- weeks post treatment.

Secondary Objective: To determine what secondary outcomes such as quality of life, headaches, pain sensitivity, neck mobility, anxiety, and depression improve with active tDCS treatment in individuals suffering with CGH. Quality of life will be measured via the European Quality of Life Five Dimension (EQ-5D), headache intensity will be measured via the Headache Intensity Test - 6 (HIT-6), headache effects on participant function will be measured via the Headache Disability Index (HDI), pain sensitivity will be measured via the Pain Sensitivity Questionnaire (PSQ), neck mobility will be measured through various motor control, strength, and endurance tests, feelings of depression will be measured via the PHQ-9 and anxiety via the GADS-7 before treatment after treatment and at 6- and 12- weeks post treatment.

Third objective: To explore whether the effects of active tDCS will augment the effects of rehabilitation therapy in treating individuals with CGH.

METHODS

This study will be a double-blind, sham-controlled, concealed allocation, randomized, clinical trial.

Clinical Assessments: Demographic information will be collected two weeks prior to starting the study including age, sex, education, headache history, concussion history, past medical history, medication use, and family medical history. Baseline questionnaires will be completed including 2-weeks of Headache Diaries Headache Impact Test - 6 (HIT-6), Rivermead PPCS questionnaire (RPQ), Headache Disability Index (HDI), European Quality of Life Five Dimension (EQ-5D), Section A of the Quantitative Analgesics Questionnaire (QAQ-A), patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), generalized anxiety disorder scale-7 (GADS-7), Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Pain Interference Sub-scale (PROMIS-PI), the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), and the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS). Furthermore the following baseline neck mobility assessments will be used: the Craniocervical Flexion Test (CCFT), the Cervical Extensor Endurance Test (CEET), the Dynamometry Neck-Strength Assessment (DNSA), a range of cervical motion assessment (ROM), and a manual examination of the cervical joints (MECJ). Patients will keep a two-week baseline headache diary before treatment, 2 weeks during treatment, 2 weeks following tDCS, and for 2 weeks before the 6 and 12 week follow up assessments (total of 8 weeks). Patients will be reassessed at the completion of their tDCS treatment, and at 6- and 12-weeks post-treatment. The assessments administered at each follow up are: 2-week Headache Diaries, RPQ, HIT-6, HDI, EQ-5D, PHQ-9, GAD-7, QAQ-A, NPRS, PSQ, CCFT, CEET, DNSA, ROM, and MECJ.

tDCS Protocol: Patients will engage in a six-week treatment protocol with 3 sessions per week (18 treatments). This was chosen to give participants at least a day between each session in order to minimize discomfort and because the number of sessions is consistent with previous migraine literature. The primary motor cortex (M1) will be the treatment target given previous literature highlighting reduced pain sensitivity and improved motor learning outcomes following tDCS stimulation of this region. M1 will be found through measurements of the head; more specifically the point halfway between the nasion and inion as well as halfway between the left and right tragus will be found, from here we will move down 20% of the distance between the left and right tragus while staying on the line between tragi. The anode will be placed over the M1 while the cathode will be placed over the super orbital region; each electrode will be held in place with a strap and will make as much contact with the skin as possible. tDCS will be delivered via two 35cm2 surface sponge electrodes at an intensity of 2mA in the active group and 0mA in the sham group. There will be a 30 second fade in and fade out period before and after stimulation with 20 minutes of active stimulation. In the sham condition, participants will only experience the 30 second fade in period and then the stimulator will be turned off. Previous sham studies have demonstrated the efficacy of this blinding method.

Physiotherapy Protocol: Participants will engage in a six-week physiotherapy program which will occur immediately following each tDCS session. The exercises to be used focus on head and back strength and motor control and were assembled by a licensed physiotherapist based on previous physiotherapy protocols for treating CGH. The exercises are performed at a level that is pain-free and are progressed when goals are reached (approximately every 2 weeks). Participants will also be expected to increase daily physical activity levels to 30 minutes per day for at least 5 days a week as a part of the physiotherapy program. This will be tracked using an exercise diary to be completed by participants each day.

Statistical Analysis: Summary statistics will be done and reported so that feasibility and safety can be assessed and future studies can use the results presented for power calculations.","INTERVENTIONAL","RANDOMIZED","PARALLEL","TREATMENT","Double blind randomized placebo controlled clinical trial.",NA,NA,"QUADRUPLE","Participants, researcher, and care providers will be blinded until after the analysis period, researchers will be assessing outcomes.",32,"ESTIMATED","Inclusion Criteria:

Emerging evidence suggests that migraineurs, especially women \< 45 years who have aura, have an increased risk of stroke and myocardial infarction (MI, or heart attack). The mechanism linking migraine, stroke and MI is unclear although increased platelet activation and aggregation observed during and between migraine attacks may be a plausible theory.

Aspirin is an inexpensive, relatively safe antiplatelet drug that reduces the risk of stroke and MI. Preliminary data suggest that aspirin's (325mg) therapeutic effect on platelet inhibition may be reduced in migraineurs (i.e., aspirin resistance), thus limiting aspirin's effectiveness at preventing stroke and MI risks in persons with migraine. Additional research is warranted to confirm these findings in migraineurs because daily, low-dose aspirin 81 mg is the recommended first line therapy for primary and secondary prevention of stroke and MI

The researchers hypothesize that resistance to aspirin 81mg may occur more frequently in women with episodic and chronic migraine than in women without migraine. The findings may have important implications for women who have migraine and use aspirin to prevent migraine symptoms or comorbidities associated with migraine including stroke and MI.","To test the hypothesis that the rate of aspirin resistance is greater in women with episodic and chronic migraine than in women without migraine, a three-group, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design will be used to test the effects of aspirin 81 mg on platelet reactivity. Subjects will be randomized to treatment order (A) aspirin 81 mg for 10-14 consecutive days followed by placebo for 10-14 consecutive days or (B) placebo for 10-14 consecutive days followed by aspirin 81 mg for 10-14 consecutive days. Other than treatment order, subjects will be treated equally. Study procedures will be performed at the University of Washington, and the duration of the study per subject will be approximately 28 days. Endpoints include: a) Aspirin Reaction Units (ARU) using a point-of-care assay (VerifyNow Aspirin™; Accumetrics, San Diego, CA); b) serum thromboxane B2; and c) percent platelet inhibition on aspirin.

Gadolinium will be injected with ASIS subdermally (30) or conventional intramuscularly (30) for these 6 muscle groups: Glabella, Frontal, Temporal, Occipital, Paraspinal, and Trapezius. An MRI will be taken promptly after Gadolinium injection, as starting reference, to which subsequent MRI taken at 6 hrs, 12 hrs, and 24 hrs later will be compared for Persistent %. Since there isn't a way to measure level of Gadolinium within it, or any other (e.g. Botox) for that matter, at least the Prolongation of Gadolinium may be approximated by the greater or longer Persistent % on MRI. However, this approximation can only work if the variables are minimized to the same population with Chronic Migraine, and these particular 6 muscle groups. Case in point, patients with Chronic Migraine presumably have hyperactive Glabella, Frontal, Temporal, Occipital, Paraspinal, and Trapezius muscles, so expectantly will have shortened Gadolinium intramuscularly Persistent %, and somewhat Gadolinium subdermally Persistent % as well due to agitation, thus these Persistent % values in Chronic Migraine patients will not be like those of normal patients, or even the same between these 6 different muscle groups. Therefore, the Relative Prolongation Ability Score or total Persistent % subdermally over total Persistent % intramuscularly, will be specific and valuable indicators to help us modify the Botox dosage and duration to inject into that ""unknown"" subdermal bloodless space for Aim 2.

Although valuable, that Relative Prolongation Ability Score from Aim 1 isn't absolutely required to start Aim 2. Hypothetically speaking, if that subdermal bloodless space in patients with e.g., Chronic Migraine somehow failed to show prolongation of half-life for Gadolinium in Aim 1, we can still proceed with primary interest being therapeutic comparison for Botox in Aim 2, in terms of reduction in Number of Headache Days from Baseline, and adverse reactions.","INTERVENTIONAL","RANDOMIZED","PARALLEL","TREATMENT",NA,NA,NA,"DOUBLE",NA,60,"ESTIMATED","Inclusion Criteria:

Motor impairment after a stroke is common and can be debilitating. To date, there remain few treatments available to help improve motor recovery after a stroke, making this an important area of research. Novel use of neuromodulation such as Invasive Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) has been shown to improve motor recovery in stroke patients. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), in which the nerve is stimulated with electrical pulses, has demonstrated success for a variety of conditions, including inflammation, depression, cognitive dysfunction, chronic fatigue, headaches/migraines, pain, insomnia, and cardiovascular issues. Very recently, non-invasive options have been developed and might be a promising alternative. The research in this area is still very limited and much more research is needed to investigate non-invasive/trancutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) related biomechanisms and to further support its efficacy in acute patients. The purpose of this study is to build upon the current research to investigate changes in electrical brain activity (using electrophysiology) related to improvements in both motor and cognitive recovery following the use of taVNS in acute stroke patients.","To date, there are only few treatments available to help improve recovery after a stroke. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is FDA approved for the treatment of epilepsy, migraines, and refractory depression. However, there are many novel applications that are being actively researched and show great promise. One such application is to enhance neurologic recovery after stroke. Dawson et al performed a clinical trial that showed implanted VNS improved motor recovery in patients with upper extremity motor deficits following an ischemic stroke. Due to its invasive nature, implanted VNS is often viewed as an impractical option. An alternative is to stimulate the vagus nerve externally, thus avoiding surgery and surgical complications. One approach is transcutaneous auricular VNS (taVNS) at the tragus. This region of the external ear is partially innervated by the auricular branch of the vagus nerve, making it a good site for cutaneous stimulation. The tragus also offers some advantages in terms of ease of applying electricity to the anterior wall of the external ear canal by being able to clip onto the tragus. Furthermore, studies have shown that stimulation through the auricular canal causes activation of the vagus nerve pathway, comparable to direct stimulation of the nerve itself. Thus far, the available literature has focused mostly on patients with chronic stroke (\>6 months) showing preliminary safety and efficacy for such technique. Time-window might be an important factor impacting treatment efficacy. Applying taVNS in acute patients where neural plasticity is still occurring in a stable but healing brain might be more impactful than in chronic patients where most of the damages have occurred and neural plasticity has slow down drastically. One double-blinded randomized controlled study by Li and co-workers (2022) in 60 acute stroke patients showed that combining taVNS with conventional rehabilitation improved safely the recovery of motor functions at follow-up (until one year post-treatment) as compared to sham. However, that study does not investigate the biomechanisms of such recovery. Understanding how taVNS changes neural functioning is nevertheless crucial in order to understand its mechanisms of action in the acute stage. In this study, electroencephalography (EEG) will be used since this technique is easily implementable in clinical settings and, since a substantial amount of research have linked EEG recordings at rest (e.g., delta to alpha power ratio) to later recovery after stroke. Previous research was also limited to assessing motor recovery and could benefit from a more holistic approach including the assessment of its impact on cognitive recovery. Finally, taVNS sessions were given to acute patients while hospitalized over the course of 4 weeks while the average length of stay in the US is between 1 and 3 weeks depending on the severity of impairments in stroke patients. Therefore, this study will also assess if both motor and cognitive improvements can be obtained in stroke patients using a shorter time frame (2 weeks).","INTERVENTIONAL","NA","SINGLE_GROUP","TREATMENT",NA,NA,NA,"NONE",NA,22,"ESTIMATED","Inclusion Criteria:

Secondary objectives are to 1) Measure the adherence patterns of youth who are prescribed a specific aerobic home exercise programs. 2) Monitor longitudinal symptom reduction on the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool 5 (SCAT5) (week 0 and medical clearance) 3) Track longitudinal changes in patient-reported outcomes (symptoms) through the use of the Pediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL) questionnaire. 4) Evaluate the association between cognitive activity and time to receive medical clearance to return to sport.

Methods: A multisite RCT will be conducted at the Pan Am Concussion Program, Winnipeg, Manitoba and the Sport Injury Prevention Research Centre/Acute Sport Concussion Clinic, Sport Medicine Centre, Faculty of Kinesiology, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta. Adolescents (n=136, 68 from each study site, ages 13-19 years) who are diagnosed with a sport-related concussion and have ongoing symptoms for more than 10 days but less than 30 days will be recruited for study participation. Participants will be randomized via permuted block to either a moderate intensity (80%) or a low intensity (60%) aerobic exercise intervention. Both groups will be instructed to perform their respective home aerobic exercise program the beginning the day after completing their first treadmill test. Participants will be instructed to exercise at their prescribed intensity for a maximum of 30 minutes a day, 4-5 days a week. In the unlikely event in which participants feel unable to continue their home exercise program they will be asked to postpone the exercise until the next day. Participants will undergo diagnostic treadmill tests every two weeks, which will be used to determine increases in exercise tolerance and serve as a parameter of physiological recovery. The treadmill tests will also be used to set a new threshold heart rate for a person to continue to exercise at for the following two weeks or until receiving medical clearance to initiate the return to play protocol. The treadmill test is made to represent the most similar form of exercise to mimic an adolescent's respective sport.

Participants will also be asked to fill out the SCAT5 symptom scores before and after treadmill testing along with the PedsQl questionnaire. Self-reported physical and cognitive activity will be tracked with daily exercise logs, these will be used in conjunction with Actigraph accelerometers and heart rate monitors which will serve as objective tools to track the quantification of physical activity.

Data safety and monitoring: The study team at the University of Manitoba have performed over 200 treadmill tests in a pediatric concussed population with no challenges regarding safety or tolerability. The study staff will be qualified to perform exercise stress tests in a safe manner based on standards of practice imposed by the University of Calgary and Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology. All study practices will be conducted under the supervision of a physician and exercise physiologist who are trained at a minimum level of cardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) level C and trained to use an automated external defibrillator (AED). All study personnel will know the location and how to use the on-site AED's. Monthly teleconferences will be held between the research team at the University of Manitoba and University of Calgary regarding, safety, logistics and proper manners in which to conduct exercise tests. Between both sites we will establish a data safety and monitoring committee to ensure the safety of all patients. This independent group of experts will monitor patient safety and treatment efficacy during the ongoing RCT and report their findings to the primary investigators. The committee's role will be to periodically review and evaluate the data collected thus far for any concerns related to patient safety or study conduct. If needed, they will also provide recommendations about the continuation, modification, or termination of the RCT.","INTERVENTIONAL","RANDOMIZED","PARALLEL","TREATMENT","Research statement:This study is a multi-centre RCT.

2. Assessing the impact of an intervention designed to change ANS-R on the clinical course of IC/BPS;
3. Evaluating changes in brain connectivity between the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the periaqueductal gray (PAG) associated with changes in ANS-R and improved disease status.

Subjects will be pre-screened in person or on the phone. An in-person pre-screen takes place in the MCW Neurology Research Rooms at Froedtert Hospital. If the subject is able to participate, subject will sign the informed consent form before completing a baseline evaluation. The baseline evaluation occurs either following consent or at another date convenient for them. Subjects must complete all baseline activities within 2 weeks, or before their Week 4/Visit 2. The baseline evaluation is comprised of a general examination, a set of questionnaires, background history documenting date of diagnosis, medications tried, duration of each treatment and dosing, surgeries and therapeutic and exploratory procedures performed. A pelvic examination will be performed with CPP subjects patients only. Active Change in Posture (ACP) is administered to the subject. Subjects will complete the uroflow (urine) measurement and Valsalva maneuver in the MCW Neurology Research Rooms with a member of the research team present.

Observational Substudy:

This substudy is identical to the above with the exception of not taking a beta-blocker or placebo and is only 12 weeks long instead of 24. This is strictly an observational study to monitor subjects who have been diagnosed with IC or MPP. If the screening information shows that the subject meets the requirements, then they will be able to start. If the screening information shows that they cannot be in the research, the research doctor will discuss other options with them and/or refer them back to their regular doctor.

If the subject is able to participate, they will complete 3 regular on-site long-visits at weeks 0, 4, and 12. The first long-visit (baseline evaluation) may occur either today following consent or at another date convenient for them. The baseline evaluation comprises a general and pelvic examination (no speculum), psychological questionnaires and a background history questionnaire.

Weekly Home Checks will occur for 24 weeks (or 12 weeks if in observational sub-study) following consent. Once each a week, subjects will complete a 24-hour heart rate (HR) recording and the ACP recording using the eMotion Faros 360° portable EKG device. A member of the research team will contact the subject each week while they complete the weekly questionnaires and ACP recording. This will ensure compliance and will give the subject the opportunity to ask any questions.The researcher will remain on the phone or via Skype to monitor the subject while the ACP recording is completed from home just prior to the subject's bedtime. The HR recording will be uploaded to MCW's secure server at the subject's next hospital visit. Throughout the study, subjects flare activity will be monitored via phone calls and recording flares in the EMA application on the smartphone. This will be a Daily Flare Question in the EMA which is a set alarmed time to sound as a reminder for the duration of the subject's participation.

The following weeks after each site visit and the night before visit 5, subjects will repeat complete the 24-hr HR recording to ensure comparability of the HRV recording at home to the one performed at the matching on-site visit., Subjects will also complete the 24-h voiding diary, a set of questions using the ICECAN mobile App installed on a pre-loaded smartphone and questionnaires. Deidentified 24-hour HRV and ACP recordings will be sent to Ohio State University for analysis.

Follow-up Visits: Weeks 4, 12, 16, 24, Visits 2-5 (weeks 4 and 12 (Visits 2 and 3) for the observational substudy) Subjects will arrive to MCW Neurology Research Rooms to repeat the following: review of comorbidities, tender points exam, questionnaires, ACP and DNIC tests. Subjects will complete the Valsalva maneuver in the MCW Neurology Research Rooms with a member of the research team present. Chronic Pelvic Pain patients subjects will complete a repeat pelvic examination at Weeks 12 and 24.

MPP and IC/BPS patients subjects will be randomized to receive 8 weeks of either placebo (a pill with no active agent), or metoprolol (a pill that reduces the impact of the brain's ""fight or flight"" circuits). Metoprolol is in the class of ""beta-blockers"" commonly used for mild blood pressure control, and also commonly used for migraine.

Methods: A total of 58 women within the age range of 20 to 45 were screened for eligibility in terms of suitability for participation in the study. Two separate progressive relaxation training sessions were administered to two distinct groups: one comprised of women with TTH and the other consisting of women with migraine. Pre- and post-training assessments were conducted for both groups as follows. Both intervention groups were instructed and trained by a physiotherapist 2times a week for 30 minutes each over 6 weeks,","The International Headache Society (IHS) reported that approximately 90% of headaches consist of tension-type headache (TTH) and migraine, which are the primary type of headache, and affect approximately 50% of the population. The incidence of headaches and migraines is to peak at the age of 20-50, and is more common in women than in men. Recurrent tension-type headaches and migraine attacks negatively affect the quality of life of individuals, reducing working capacity and participation in social and family activities. Therefore, tension-type headaches and migraines cause significant social exclusion, loss of workforce and economic burden.

TTH and migraine impede personal care, productivity and leisure activities, which are an integral part of individuals' lives due to symptoms such as pain, fatigue, difficulty concentrating and/or dizziness. Participation in purposeful activities for individuals is an essential component of health and well-being. Activity self-efficiency is a definition that includes the sense of personal competence and satisfaction about the activities women engage in. When individuals engage in work, play, and daily life activities, women sustain, reinforce, shape, and modify women's capacities, beliefs, and tendencies. High self-efficiency perception can affect the sustainability of physical activity and the productivity of individuals. Both TTH and Migraine tend to occur during the most productive and high-capacity phase of life, between ages 25-55, affecting muscle groups used in daily life activities, potentially leading to limitations in participation, coping, and self-management skills among women. In this regard, it is important to study how tension-type headaches and migraines, which have significant social and individual effects, alter the self-sufficiency and perception of activity in women. Constant thinking of pain and avoiding physical activity can reveal dysfunction in individuals. Because of the individual-specific and complex structure of human roles, each individual suffering from a headache faces different limitations in fulfilling daily roles and social participation, depending on lifestyle and preferences. Thus, non-pharmacological treatments (physiotherapy practices, lifestyle changes, cognitive behavioral therapy, body awareness therapy) are recommended for women with TTH and migraine complaints to relax various muscle groups. One of these treatments is progressive relaxation training. PRT is defined as a method of voluntary, regular relaxation of large muscle groups in the human body with relaxation throughout the body. Specifically, applying PRT to muscle groups found in hands, arms, neck, shoulders, face, chest, abdomen, hips, feet, and fingers, which are most frequently utilized in daily life activities, enhances its benefits for individuals. In the literature, various studies reported that PRT improved occupational performance, participation in daily life activities and quality of life in addition to pain management in individuals with various chronic pains. According to the knowledge, there exists no study in the literature comparing the beneficial effects that PRT, one of the optimal treatments that can be applied in women with TTH or migraine, can have on these two distinct headache groups. Furthermore, studies examining the impact of PRT on activity self-efficacy perception and social participation are quite limited. The aim of this study is to investigate and compare the effects of PRT on pain characteristics, attack frequency, activity self-efficacy perception, and social participation in women with two different types of headaches, TTH and migraine. This study will enable clinicians working with women suffering from TTH and migraine to comprehensively evaluate them in clinical settings and provide more comprehensive intervention approaches to address challenges encountered in daily life.","INTERVENTIONAL","RANDOMIZED","PARALLEL","TREATMENT",NA,NA,NA,"NONE",NA,40,"ESTIMATED","Inclusion Criteria:

Specifically, they will attempt to identify the dates on which dizziness was reported.","Dizziness is a common condition that is responsible for a significant degree of material morbidity and burden on our health service. There are multiple causes of dizziness, and these originate from pathologies affecting a large variety of different organ systems. Dizziness is usually episodic and short-lived, so when a patient presents to their health care provider, examination is often normal. As such, diagnosis is challenging and patients often experience significant delay in receiving a diagnosis.

The investigators have developed a prototype device for monitoring dizziness and have tested it in a group of 17 healthy volunteers. The results showed that their device is capable of accurately, precisely and reliably identifying short periods of induced nystagmus (eye movements produced during dizzy attacks) among days' worth of normal eye movement data.

The overall aim of this trial is to test a fully evolved device for the continuous recording of eye movements over a prolonged period of time, on patients suffering from dizziness. For the purpose of this study, the monitoring period is 23 hours a day, for 30 days. The device is composed of two components: a bespoke single-use sensor array that adheres to the participant's face, and a small reusable module that contains a battery, microcomputer, data storage facility, battery and connection port.

The investigators intend to confirm that the device data can be used to identify any occurrence of nystagmus, as produced during attacks of vertigo. Each trial participant will be provided with the device and enough single-use electrode arrays to allow the array to be changed every 24 hours, for thirty days. Participants will be allowed to remove the sensor array for up to 60 minutes each day to allow them to wash and/or shower. If patients experience an episode of dizziness during the trial, they are required to log the details of the event in a trial diary. The identity of these days will not be revealed to the blinded investigator who will later conduct a formal, blinded analysis of the data.

There is evidence supporting a causal relationship between the occurrence of drug-induced ""restrictive"" valvular heart disease and treatment with pergolide (3): in several cases, the valvulopathy improved when pergolide was discontinued (4). Valvular heart damage has also been reported with the ergot-derived dopamine agonists bromocriptine and cabergoline (5,6).

Two recent studies (7,8) have further demonstrated that both pergolide and cabergoline are associated with an increased risk of new cardiac valve regurgitation in patients treated for Parkinson's disease.

The valvular abnormalities seen with ergot-derived dopamine agonists are similar to those observed in patients receiving ergot alkaloid agents (such as ergotamine and methysergide) in the treatment of migraine, or fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine in the treatment of obesity. These abnormalities also closely resemble carcinoid-related valvulopathies (9).

Cardiac valve disease has never been reported in patients with prolactinomas who require treatment with dopamine-agonists even life-long (1). At variance with patients with Parkinson's disease, patients with prolactinomas are younger and are treated with an average dose of dopamine-agonists that is significantly lower (median bromocriptine dose 5 mg/day and median cabergoline dose 1 mg/week). Because of the young age of treatment beginning (most patients with microprolactinomas start dopamine-agonist treatment in early adulthood), treatment might be continued for over 3 decades: the cumulative risk of low doses of dopamine agonists for such a long period of treatment is currently unknown.

To assess the prevalence of cardiac valve disease in patients treated with cabergoline, we wish to perform an echocardiography screening in a large representative sample of patients with prolactinoma who were treated with cabergoline for at least 12 months and in a group of control subjects recruited prospectively.

Recent studies have shown that children and adolescents suffer from vestibular impairments, yet the numbers are still low due to some factors, including the non-typical presentations. Vestibular migraine has been found to be the most common condition of vestibular dysfunction among children and adolescents. Nonetheless, most children remain undiagnosed due to lack awareness and vague clinical presentations. Parallel to that, there has been no consensus regarding the management algorithm. Most children are managed with pharmacological management extrapolated from the adult algorithm. Many clinicians fail to understand that pharmacological treatments are not sustainable long-term and should focus on lifestyle modifications such as sleep and dietary habits and other non-pharmacological treatments such as deep breathing exercises and vestibular rehabilitation therapy. This study aims to investigate the effect of non-pharmacological treatment in managing children and adolescents with VM. The investigators will use a standardised questionnaire before and after interventions to investigate the effect of lifestyle modifications, simple vestibular rehabilitation exercises and deep breathing techniques in children and adolescents with VM. Lifestyle modifications and vestibular rehabilitation exercise is a more sustainable way of managing children and adolescents with VM, avoiding the side effects of medication, and is more cost-effective. If the non-pharmacological treatment shows promising results, the investigators will continue with multicentre randomised-controlled studies.","The prevalence of vestibular dysfunction is approximately 30.4% among children and adolescents. Yet, the exact prevalence in children remains a quandary owing to several factors: difficulties describing symptoms and cannot differentiate between true vertigo, unsteadiness, imbalance and light-headedness; secondly, the short-lived nature of some peripheral vestibular conditions results in early and rapid compensation; thirdly, nuanced clinical manifestations of vestibular as well as balance impairment accounts for it being overlooked finally, lack of specialists to manage children with vestibular impairment.

Vestibular dysfunction or impairment results in disturbance in the body's balance system. Nonetheless, the most common symptoms include vertigo, nausea, vomiting, intolerance to head motion, nystagmus, unsteady gait, and postural instability. Although clinical presentation may be mild, vestibular dysfunction may impact the quality of life and day-to-day activity, especially school activities such as reading and learning, which are vital for these age groups.

Vestibular loss affects cognitive and emotional disturbance related to reflexive deficits, which are related to the role of ascending vestibular pathway to the limbic system and the neocortex's role in the sense of spatial orientation. Vestibular and balance impairment amongst adolescents and young adults will, in the long term, affect social, emotional, psychological and quality of life as vestibular and balance function is imperative in day-to-day life and activity.

Vestibular migraine (VM) is found to be the most common cause of dizziness among children and adolescents. The exact prevalence of VM remains unknown as VM is still underdiagnosed due to a lack of awareness amongst parents and attending physicians. It is worth noting that the diagnosis of VM in children and adolescents has traditionally been based on the description of clinical symptoms by the patient or parents/caretaker. The lack of definitive biomarkers and gold-standard diagnostic tools contributes to the delay in diagnosis. The typical battery of investigations, including otological, neurological, ophthalmological, and imaging performed, are oftentimes carried out to rule out other pathological disorders.

Vestibular migraine in children is diagnosed based on diagnostic criteria which recently has been put forth by the Committee for the Classification of Vestibular Disorders of the Bar any Society (ICVD) and the Migraine Classification subgroup of the International Headache Society, which describes the three spectrums of VM: Vestibular Migraine of Childhood, probable Vestibular Migraine of Childhood and Recurrent Vertigo of Childhood specific for children under 18 years of age.

No gold standard investigation tool exists to diagnose VM, as the available investigations are performed mainly to exclude other conditions such as Meniere's disease and BPPV.

Additionally, there is no evidence-based approach for treating VM in children and adolescents, with most recommendations extrapolated from reports on adult and childhood migraine headaches. Only two included studies described medication for VM. Overall, treatment for VM can be divided into pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment. Pharmacological treatment of VM in children includes those taken during acute attacks and prophylactic treatment. Vestibular suppressants and triptans have been used to abort acute attacks in children and adolescents, although the exact efficacy is still unknown.

Non-pharmacological treatment aimed as a prophylactic measure such as eliminating migraine-triggering diet, vestibular rehabilitation, supplements, and a healthy lifestyle. Triggering factors such as increased screen time and usage of immersive technology needs attention parallel to getting adequate sleep, a healthy diet and breathing exercise. Lifestyle modifications have shown significant improvement among adult patients diagnosed with definite VM. Yet, no studies involving children and adolescents. The investigators aim to conduct a study to investigate the effect of lifestyle modifications, simple home-based vestibular rehabilitation and deep breathing exercise in children and adolescents diagnosed with VM. Lifestyle modifications, vestibular rehabilitation exercise and deep breathing exercise is a more sustainable way of managing children and adolescents with VM, avoids the side effects of medication, and is cost-effective.

Hypothesis The investigators hypothesise that non-pharmacological treatment which involves lifestyle modifications, home-based vestibular rehabilitation therapy and deep relaxation breathing, will be effective in controlling and reducing the symptoms of vestibular migraine in children and adolescents.

Innovation The majority of the studies on pharmacological interventions for vestibular migraine revolve around adult patients. Although the optimal treatment algorithm among adult vestibular migraine remains debatable, the effect of lifestyle modifications in vestibular migraine adult patients has shown promising results. The current research is innovative as the investigators will use an elaborate guide of lifestyle modifications which focuses on the child's dietary, sleep, and lifestyle habits, including increased physical activity, reduction of screen time as well as incorporating simple home-based vestibular rehabilitation therapy and deep breathing exercise. All children and adolescents will be diagnosed with vestibular migraine of childhood according to the Barany Consensus criteria. The investigators will divide the participants into 2 groups: children and adolescents. The investigators believe that the proposed investigation will be a more sustainable way to control, reduce vestibular migraine symptoms, and improve the overall quality of life among the participants. The findings from this research will be the foundation and pave the way for future larger-scale multicentre studies.

Research plan The investigators propose that an elaborate guide to lifestyle modifications focusing on the child's dietary, sleep, lifestyle habits, in addition to simple home-based vestibular rehabilitation therapy and deep breathing exercise, will reduce and improve vestibular symptoms in children and adolescents. No studies on non-pharmacological intervention among children and adolescents with vestibular migraine have been published. Yet, data involving adult patients have shown promising results, although no study involving adult patients with vestibular migraine has looked into the effect of lifestyle modifications which includes dietary and sleep habits, in addition to incorporating vestibular rehabilitation therapy and deep breathing exercise in a single study.

Justification of the study

Lifestyle modifications have successfully prevented Vestibular migraine (VM) in the adult study. No studies involving children and adolescents with VM have been carried out. The investigators aim to conduct a study to investigate the effect of lifestyle modifications and simple vestibular rehabilitation in children and adolescents diagnosed with VM. Lifestyle modifications and vestibular rehabilitation exercise is a more sustainable way of managing children and adolescents with VM, avoiding the side effects of medication and being cost-effective.

It is important to investigate the effects of lifestyle modifications on VM because the underlying causes of vestibular migraine are unclear. Our modifications include food triggers, restful sleep, exercise, eating regularity, vestibular rehabilitation, and deep breathing exercise. The investigators hypothesize comprehensive lifestyle modifications, vestibular rehabilitation, and deep breathing exercise will improve vestibular migraine symptoms. This project is important because vestibular migraine is reported to be one of the most common causes of vertigo, and interventions useful for other migraine types or vestibular symptoms may not be effective for VM in children and adolescents. If the investigators demonstrate improvement with comprehensive lifestyle modifications, the investigators will continue the line of investigation with randomized, controlled studies. This work furthers our goal of helping children and adolescents with VM.

Main Objective To investigate the effects of elaborate lifestyle modifications, vestibular rehabilitation therapy and deep breathing exercise among children and adolescents with vestibular migraine.

Specific Objective

In addition to the strong relationship with migraine, fibromyalgia can also be associated with sleep disorders, chronic fatigue and psychological disorders. The combination of these factors decreases the quality of life and contributes to increased sedentary this population. It is known that physical exercise promotes positive changes in pain pathophysiological pathway to increase the release of endorphins neuroendógenas, improving the symptoms of fibromyalgia.

The objective of this study is to analyze whether the application of an aerobic exercise program may result in the reduction of the frequency, duration and intensity of migraine attacks in women with fibromyalgia. For this, a clinical trial will be conducted randomized double-blind clinical trial comparing two groups of women diagnosed with fibromyalgia and migraine. Initially, all answer questionnaires assessing quality of life, impact of headache, level of depression and anxiety, sleep quality, physical activity level, and; will be held ergospirometry for research in exercise tolerance. The experimental group will implement the protocol consists of heating, aerobic exercise according to the heart rate established for training by spirometry and slowdown; and the control group will hold the heat on low speed and heart rate will next baseline. Both groups will be followed for 12 weeks, with a frequency of three weekly meetings lasting 30 minutes and re-evaluated every 4 weeks. At the end of the protocol, the groups will have their results were compared and statistically analyzed.","This study is classified as a randomized double-blind clinical trial. Will be held in the Department of Physiotherapy of the university clinic of the Federal University of Pernambuco, located in University City, Recife-PE. Data for the survey will be collected during the course of the Masters in Physiotherapy, from April 2015 to September 2015, for further analysis.

The analyzed groups shall consist of women aged 30-50 years referred to the Department of Physical Therapy - UFPE, with clinical diagnosis of fibromyalgia and migraine performed by doctors of Rheumatology clinics and Neurology, Hospital das Clinicas, UFPE. Being invited to participate and informed about its content, saying their participation by signing a Term of Consent. Data collection is in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and will begin after the project was approved by the Ethics Committee for Research on Human beings of the Federal University Health Sciences Center of Pernambuco, in accordance with Resolution 466/2012 of the National Research Ethics Committee of the Ministry of Health, the body that regulates research involving human subjects. The study will be registered in the digital Clinical Trials platform after obtaining the registration number of the Ethics Committee. Initially there will be a pilot study with 20 women, then the results will be used to calculate the sample size using the G Power (version 3.1.9.2, Germany), considering a statistical power (β) of 80% with a significance level (α) of 5%.

Will be excluded those that have some other rheumatologic disease, cardio-respiratory or cardiovascular that prevents the realization of aerobic exercise protocol; low attendance during the implementation of the exercise program (over three consecutive absences); cognitive impairment or neurological disease that compromises the understanding and the exercises; Body mass index ≥ 30.0 (obesity, according to the World Society of Health); pregnant women and patients classified as level of active or very active physical activity by IPAQ (International Physical Activity Questionnaire).

3.1. Randomization

Initially, patients will undergo will a simple randomization through the site www.randomization.com, resulting in two groups:

1. Aerobic Training: Submitted to a protocol consisting of heating, aerobic training with adequate heart rate and slowdown;
2. Control Training: Heating Protocol with speed and low intensity (heart rate will next basal).

Randomization will be performed by an examiner A, not research participant to ensure allocation concealment (patients and principal investigator will not be aware of which group are allocated). All women will be evaluated (both groups) through questionnaires and spirometry before the start and the end of the exercise protocol. Every four weeks, the patients will be submitted to revaluations through the questionnaires. The evaluation of these volunteers will be conducted by an examiner B (principal investigator), blinded to randomization; and the exercise protocol implementation will be the responsibility of the examiner C, only one will know to which group the patients belong. Corroborating the double-blinding, the evaluator to perform statistical analysis of the data will not know to which group belongs the results.

3.2. Evaluation

* Socio-demographic questionnaire Prepared by the researcher to characterize the groups, which answer questions for identification and history (name, date of valuation, telephone, address, date of birth, age, weight, height, body mass index / BMI, profession, education, marital status, physical activity and frequency, use of medication, type of medication, medication time). One minunciosa history regarding the use of drugs will be held: types, frequency, duration of treatment.
* Identification of the impact of migraine Will be evaluated by the Migraine Disability Assessment Test (MIDAS), which contains five items that measure the amount of days lost in the activities of daily living (ADLs) and professional (AVPs) due to the presence of migraine in the last three months; the patient declares the amount of days and, from the result of the sum of the scores, ranks the degree of disability of the individual (0-5 points: grade I / minimal disability; 6-10 points: grade II / mild disability; 11-20 points: grade III / moderate disability;\> 20 points: grade IV / severe disability).
* Clinical characteristics of the headache Will be filled the journal Headache, based on criteria established by the International Headache Society (ICHD-III beta version, 2013); assesses the amount and duration of migraine attacks over a period of 30 days, pain intensity, symptoms associated with headache, medication use.
* Investigation of sleep quality The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), used to measure the subjective quality of sleep; consists of 19 items divided into seven components that punctuate 0-3 (total score of 0-21 points, the higher the score, the worse the quality of sleep). Was adapted and validated for the Brazilian population by Bertolazi and colleagues (2011), with a high reliability (α Cronbach = 0.82).
* Quality of life assessment Measured by the FIQ (Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire), consisting of 19 questions divided into 10 items: the first item has 10 sub-items with four response options ranging from 0-4 points; the second and third items, the patient should choose an option on a scale of 0-7; in the other, is given a score of 0-10 in response (the higher the score, the greater the impact of fibromyalgia on quality of life). Adapted and validated for the Brazilian population.
* Tracking of symptoms of anxiety and depression The presence of depression will be assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), consisting of 21 questions that add up to a maximum score of 63 points (level of depression: 0-9 points = No; 10-18 points = mild depression; 19- 29 points = moderate depression;\> 30 points = severe depression). It is validated and adapted for the Brazilian population, with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.81. The Beck Anxiety (BAI) will be used to identify and classify anxiety; consists of 23 statements that have the maximum score of 63 (0-10 points: minimum Anxiety, 11-19 points: Light Anxiety, points 20-30: moderate anxiety,\> 31 points: severe anxiety), is validated and adapted to Brazilian population.
* Evaluation of the level of physical activity Proposed by the World Health Organization (1998), the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) aims to measure the total physical activity level (AFT) from the energy expenditure (METs.min-¹). Will be used to short IPAQ (version 8), which consists of 4 questions with two sub-items (b) on activities of daily living, professional life activities and practice of walking; where the frequency and duration respond if (days and hours / minutes) of activities and its intensity (moderate or vigorous = 3.3-4 METs = 5.5 to 8 METs) for one week. From the data obtained, sum up the frequency and duration of activities (walk + moderate + vigorous intensity) and, from this result, classifies individuals in: sedentary; irregularly active; active or very active. This questionnaire is validated and adapted for the Brazilian population, with excellent reproducibility (ICC = 0.79).
* Assessment of exercise tolerance Ergospirometry or cardio-pulmonary function test assesses precisely, the cardio-respiratory capacity and metabolic by direct measurement of maximum oxygen consumption and determining the maximum ventilatory thresholds. He is currently considered the gold standard for evaluation of exercise tolerance by providing non-invasive and very precise exercise intensities featuring aerobic or anaerobic metabolism (anaerobic threshold - LA). It is the most appropriate test for prescription of aerobic exercise intensity in sedentary individuals or with regular physical activity. Oxygen consumption (VO2 max) appears to be the most accurate indicator of exercise capacity. The test will be performed on a treadmill, coupled with a spirometer and a computer system in a climatically standardized environment. To minimize air leakage, will be employed the use of face masks with tiny dead-space. The main parameters obtained in the test are the ventilatory thresholds: anaerobic threshold (AT) and respiratory compensation point, which will characterize the aerobic and anaerobic workouts. The variables obtained during the test, with clinical relevance are: maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max), carbon dioxide release (VCO 2), rate of gas exchange (R), estimated lactate threshold, expired minute volume (VE) , ventilatory reserve (RVE), ventilatory equivalents, end-expiratory pressures (PEF), ventilatory pattern, arterial gas tensions / oxyhemoglobin saturation, physiological dead space, electrocardiograms, heart rate, peripheral O2 saturation (SpO2) and blood pressure (BP ).

The responses to the cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX) are obtained by means of an incremental protocol, which consists in progressive load increases at predetermined time periods. A typical incremental protocol should provide: a resting phase (2-3 minutes or more), in which we observe a lack of hyperventilation before starting the test; a heating period with zero charge (2-3 minutes); incrementing a time (8-12 minutes) and an active period of recovery with no load (3-6 minutes if possible). For the intervention protocol, heart rate obtained just below the anaerobic threshold, recommended for proper intensity to gain fitness with greater security and compliance will be used. Generally, oxygen consumption levels in the anaerobic threshold are lower in these patients.

-Re-Reviews Initially, will be held the evaluation of patients through questionnaires and cardiopulmonary stress test to investigate exercise tolerance before the start of exercise protocol (review 1). Every 4 weeks, the patients of both groups will be reassessed by the re-application of all questionnaires: 4 weeks - review 2; 8 weeks: evaluation 3. At the end of the 12 weeks of training, the review 4 will be held, with repetition of the questionnaires and cardiopulmonary exercise testing.

3.3. Intervention protocol The intervention protocol will be made by the examiner C, one who is not blind to the research. After randomization and evaluation, patients will be allocated to one of the groups: experimental or control. After the evaluation of cardiorespiratory capacity of patients, will be established starting parameters appropriate to the level of physical activity each based on heart rate obtained just below the anaerobic threshold (ensuring aerobic work).

The experimental group will follow the following protocol: performing heating for 5 minutes at low speed on a treadmill; after heating, the speed is increased gradually until the patient reaches the proper heart rate for aerobic training obtained during cardiopulmonary exercise testing, maintaining the same for 20 minutes to perform the aerobic workout; completed, the velocity will be decreased to regain speed heating maintained for 5 minutes and finishing training. It is envisaged that in practice using the FC to ensure proper aerobic exercise for 20-60 minutes at a frequency of 3-5 times per week are effective in increasing the functional capacity of individuals with low fitness (American College of Sports Medicine - ACSM, 2006). In the control group, these women will be guided to perform 10 minutes of heating on the treadmill with a low speed that does not cause patient effort (monitored by the Borg scale and FC close to the basement).

Both groups will be followed for 12 weeks, with a driving frequency of 3 times per week. Heart rate and saturation of peripheral oxygen (SpO2) will be continuously monitored through the use of finger pulse oximeter during the course of all practices of all the volunteers of research to ensure that HR is within the established for each group","INTERVENTIONAL","RANDOMIZED","PARALLEL","TREATMENT",NA,NA,NA,"DOUBLE",NA,20,"ESTIMATED","Inclusion Criteria:

Caffeine has been demonstrated to have analgesic effects in patients treating tension type headache and is found as part of a combination including aspirin and acetaminophen as a treatment for acute migraine headache.

The mechanism by which Maxalt relieves migraine headache is believed to be through action on 5HT1B/1D receptors both on blood vessels as well as centrally. Caffeine may have effects on relief of migraine through modifying norepinephrine related mechanisms which have been suggested through clinical research. Patients commonly report that they may obtain partial or complete relief of their migraines by consuming the modest amounts of caffeine found in a cup of coffee. this is estimated to be approximately 100mg per cup. The analgesic effects of caffeine appear to be most significant in the first 3 hours after ingestion. Recent work suggests that intervention in migraine when the pain is still mild and has not persisted for a prolonged duration may increase the likelihood of complete migraine response. Therefore, the combination of the two agents with activity in migraine that work early in the migraine process, have good tolerability at the proposed doses and working via different mechanism may increase the likelihood of patients achieving better response with their migraine treatment than that which is currently available.","INTERVENTIONAL","RANDOMIZED","CROSSOVER","TREATMENT",NA,NA,NA,"DOUBLE",NA,50,"ACTUAL","Inclusion Criteria:

Epidemiological and clinical research has shown that people with migraine suffer from psychiatric disorders at a disproportionately higher rate than individuals without. Depression, in particular, is 3-5 times more common in migraine patients than in non-migraineurs. The comorbidity of depression and migraine is a major health concern as it results in poorer prognosis, remission rate, and response to treatment. In addition, an increase in the severity of migraine is associated with a parallel rise in the severity and treatment resistance of comorbid depression.

Recent research in behavioral medicine suggests that the pain experience per se does not necessarily lead to depression or impairment. Instead, it is the preoccupation with avoiding aversive stimuli associated with pain (i.e., activities, places, movements) that results in depression and disability (e.g., McCracken et al., 2005). Therefore, given that patients with migraine and/or depression exhibit more avoidance behaviors and lower activity levels than healthy controls (e.g., Stronks et al., 2004), an intervention aimed at optimizing willingness and acceptance and minimizing behavioral avoidance may be beneficial at improving both their depression and migraine and, consequently, their daily functioning.

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is an empirically based behavioral therapy that incorporates acceptance and mindfulness strategies with behavioral change strategies. ACT (in group and in individual settings) is effective in treating psychiatric disorders commonly associated with migraine, including depression, anxiety, and stress (e.g., Hayes, 2001) as well as chronic illnesses like pain and diabetes (Dahl et al, 2004; Gregg et al., 2006). Importantly, ACT resulted in positive long-term outcomes even when presented in brief form. For example, a two-day ACT workshop, in a group setting, led to improvements in depression and distress experienced by parents of children diagnosed with autism and these gains were retained 3 months later. Parents also exhibited a reduction in avoidance behaviors (Blackledge \& Hayes, 2006).","INTERVENTIONAL","NON_RANDOMIZED","PARALLEL","TREATMENT",NA,NA,NA,"NONE",NA,45,"ACTUAL","Inclusion Criteria:

RLS intracardiac shunts are associated with a number of clinically important syndromes including paradoxical thromboembolism (causing stroke or other systemic infarct), migraine headaches (particularly with aura), desaturation with obstructive sleep apnea, and decompression illness. From a research perspective, the detection of shunts in subjects with these types of syndromes is critical in helping to define the role of RLS in these disease processes. From a clinical perspective, shunt detection will be increasingly important in an era where interventional procedures for repairing cardiac defects are available for subjects determined to be at risk.

The currently accepted reference standard for detection of an intra-cardiac patent foramen ovale/atrial septal defect (PFO/ASD) RLS is a transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), a procedure that is invasive, uncomfortable, and requires conscious sedation.

Alternative options include transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) with injection of agitated saline (with and without Valsalva strain), a procedure that is far less sensitive than TEE due to the echocardiography imaging limitations seen in many adults.

Finally, transcranial Doppler (TCD) with injection of agitated saline (with and without Valsalva strain) is a newer entrant into this arena that does not require sedation or any invasive instrumentation.

The Cardiox Model 100 FDS utilizes an optical sensor positioned on the surface of the subject's skin at the scaphoid fossa of the ear. Next, a predetermined dose of an indicator dye, indocyanine green (ICG), is injected at a predetermined rate into a peripheral antecubital vein of the subject while the subject performs a breathing maneuver called a Valsalva maneuver. The exhalation by the subject into a mouthpiece connected to a pressure transducer via a flexible tubing extension, or its equivalent (ie, performing the Valsalva maneuver), is an essential step for all existing RLS detection methods. The Valsalva maneuver by the subject creates a pressure differential between the right and left sides of the heart. This Valsalva maneuver results in blood flow from the right side of the heart to the left side of the heart through an ASD, and/or causes a PFO, if present, to open, also allowing blood to flow directly from the right side to the left side of the heart without passing through the lungs (pulmonary vasculature) for oxygenation.

The Earpads, including their fluorescence sensor arrays (FSA), are used to measure the relative concentration (ie, fluorescence signal level) of ICG dye in the bloodstream as a function of time. If a premature inflection or peak occurs in the ICG dye concentration level at a time point prior to the rise and fall of the concentration associated with the main bolus of indicator, then a RLS is present in the heart. The amplitude of this premature ICG dye-dilution curve (referred to as ""RLS-indicator dilution curve"") is used to subsequently quantify the magnitude of the right-to-left shunt by ratiometrically comparing the amplitude of this RLS indicator dilution curve to the amplitude of the main indicator dilution curve associated with that portion of the injected ICG dye that follows the normal pathway from the right side of the heart, through the lungs, and into the left side of the heart (referred to as ""normal indicator dilution curve"").",NA,"INTERVENTIONAL","NA","SINGLE_GROUP","DIAGNOSTIC",NA,NA,NA,"NONE",NA,141,"ACTUAL","Inclusion Criteria:

The common forms of migraine have a multifactorial and polygenic pattern of inheritance and genetics research is crucial for a deeper understanding of migraine mechanisms. Recently, 12 genetic loci have been identified to be associated with migraine with (MA) and without aura (MA) in four large genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The functional consequences of these genetic loci in humans are yet unknown.

Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a neuropeptide which plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of migraine and is present in migraine relevant structures. CGRP can induce migraine attacks in MO patients via an adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) dependent pathway and CGRP antagonism is efficient in the treatment of migraine attacks. Also, a recent study has showed that intracellular accumulation of cAMP is crucial for the induction of migraine attacks. However, CGRP does not cause migraine attacks in familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM), an autosomal dominant subtype of MA.

The phenotype of the migraine inducing effects of CGRP might therefore be linked to some of the 12 genetic susceptibility loci that have been identified.

Besides their pain, the researchers will also assess the effect of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) in alleviating migraine headache, another complaint of Gulf veterans, which is common in the presence of widespread pain. Importantly, the researchers are partnering with a company that has made a hand-held device that allows for stimulation of the vagus nerve without the need for surgery; it works by the patient putting it on the skin overlying the vagus nerve in their neck and then turning it on for 120 second periods three times a day. The device is programmed to deliver only 6 bouts of stimulation per day - one to each side of the neck three times a day; it is then inactive until the next day.

SPG block is a treatment for migraine that has been used for two decades. It can be done by needle injection of anesthetic to the region of the SPG. However, there are now multiple catheter devices that can be used to non-invasively administer anesthetic topically through the nasal cavity to the region of the SPG where the anesthetic is then absorbed through thin membranes covering the SPG.

Various anesthetic agents have been studied however currently, to our knowledge, there is no head to head comparison of the various anesthetics used. Studies of SPG blocks in the setting of chronic migraine are few as compared to the use of SPG as acute treatment for migraine.

With the use of an RCT, we aim to determine the overall efficacy of SPG blocks used at longer intervals than have been studied in the past as compared to placebo, as well as to examine the relative efficacy of the anesthetics used most commonly and studied for SPG blocks.

The use of pharmacological prophylaxis in these patients warrants caution, whereas the use of behavioral treatments is gaining support in literature.

The main aim of MINDKIDS trial is to test the effect of a seven weekly group sessions of guided mindfulness-based meditation program on 12-month headache frequency reduction, medications intake, disability, anxiety, depression, catastrophizing, and caregivers' burden.

This is a single-arm study. All patients will participate to seven weekly guided sessions (60 minutes each) of guided mindfulness meditation, which is aimed to teach and make direct practice with skills intended to enhance sustained, non-judgmental present moment awareness. The intervention's main topics are: posture education; breath use and control; guided body scan; work with sounds; tension release; guided imagery; decentralization of thoughts. Each session is conducted by a neurologist and a psychologist expert in mindfulness practice. During the sessions, patients are asked to close their eyes and focus their attention on the breathing so that they can concentrate on the present moment and on all the sensations.

Patients were educated to promote a healthy lifestyle: regular physical activity, avoiding skipping meals, hydration, maintain a regular sleep/wake pattern at least 7-8 hours per night.","Background and significance Adolescents with Chronic Migraine (CM) and High Frequency Episodic Migraine (HFEM) without Aura, characterized by 15+ and 9-14 days with headache respectively, pose a relevant burden on adolescents' health, quality of life, as well as on their ability to perform school and leisure time activity. In addition to this, tackling such health conditions in adolescence might be of great importance to reduce the likelihood of a transition to adulthood with CM and medication overuse headache.

In this category of patients, it is suggested to avoid prescribing pharmacological prophylaxis, in favour of non-pharmacological approaches, such as nutraceuticals or behavioural techniques.

Behavioural approaches are considered helpful for younger patients with HFEM and CM to manage pain and to reduce the number of analgesics and the use preventive medications. Mindfulness, in particular, has been applied in several clinical experiences in adults with pain and migraine with encouraging results, with long term benefit similar to that obtained from pharmacological prophylaxis. The clinical use of mindfulness in adolescents is limited to few experiences, however some results in this group of patients are encouraging. A non-randomized pilot study demonstrated acceptability and feasibility of a mindfulness-based treatment for adolescents with recurrent headaches (1). Another study demonstrated how mindfulness was able to reduce depression in children and adolescents suffering from migraine associated with depression (2). A third small pilot study (3) showed positive results with the use of mindfulness in young patients with headache.

Taken as a whole, these studies seem to point out that mindfulness-based protocol for adolescents with CM or HFEM are feasible and acceptable. What has to be better addressed is the effect of such a kind of treatment: available information, however, enable us to hypothesize that reduction in headache frequency from baseline over a 12-months period could be higher or equal to 50%.","INTERVENTIONAL","NA","SINGLE_GROUP","TREATMENT","To assess the impact of a mindfulness-based group treatment for adolescents with CM and HFEM on headache frequency reduction over 12 months.",NA,NA,"NONE",NA,37,"ACTUAL","Inclusion criteria: one of the two main diagnoses are to me met.

His Dad explains the pain has been going on for a few hours and that Advil and Tyelnol haven't helped at all. He's anxious and concerned about his son because he never complains about pain - so this must be bad. After he has been seen by the doctor, the appendix appears to be the problem and the boy needs to have it removed. Dad wants his son's pain to go away but is worried because he once got a high dose of a medication and had some unwanted side effects.

Hospital Scene #2: A 14-year-old girl has been experiencing migraine headaches for the past months and is awaiting an appointment with a specialist. Today, however, the pain is the worst it's been. Mom has picked her up from school and brought her to MCH not knowing what else to do to help her. The Advil and Tylenol have not improved her pain. She desperately wants the pain to go away but is worried because she read that some pain medicines are used without any studies done to see if they work and if they are safe. (https://www.ottawalife.com/article/most-medications-prescribed-to-children-have-not-been-adequately-studied?c=9).

In both cases, these children need medicine to help their pain. The treating doctors want to give them pain medicine that will 1) be safe and 2) make the pain go away. This is what parents and the child/teenager, and the doctors want too. Some pain medicines like opioids are often used to help with pain in children. Unfortunately, opioids can have bad side effects and can, when used incorrectly or for a long time, be addictive and even dangerous. A better option would be a non-opioid, like Ketorolac, which also helps pain but is safer and has fewer side effects. The information doctors have about how much Ketorolac to give a child, though, is what has been learned from research in adults. Like with any medication, the smallest amount that a child can take while still getting pain relief is best and safest. Why give more medicine and have a higher risk of getting a side effect, if a lower dose will do the trick? This is what the researchers don't know about Ketorolac and what this study aims to find out.

Children 6-17 years old who are reporting bad pain when they are in the Emergency Department or admitted in hospital and who will be getting an intravenous line in their arm will be included in the study. Those who want to participate will understand that the goal of the study is to find out if a smaller amount of medicine improves pain as much as a larger amount. By random chance, like flipping a coin, the child will be placed into a treatment group. The difference between these treatment groups is the amount of Ketorolac they will get. One treatment will be the normal dose that doctors use at MCH, and the other two doses will be smaller. Neither the patient, parent nor doctor will know how much Ketorolac they are getting. Over two hours, the research nurse or assistant will ask the child how much pain they are in. Our research team will also measure how much time it took for the pain to get better, and whether the child had to take any other medicine to help with pain. The research team will also ask families and patients some questions to understand their perceptions of pain control, pain medicines and side effects they know of.

This research is important because it may change the way that doctors treat children with pain, not just at MCH but around the world. The results of this study will be shared with doctors through conferences and scientific papers. It's also important that clinicians share information with parents and children so that they can understand more about pain medicines and how these medicines can be used safely with the lowest chance of side effects.","Comparison of Ketorolac at Three Doses In Children With Acute Pain: A Randomized Controlled Trial (KETODOSE TRIAL)

Background: Despite the ongoing opioid crisis, opioids remain a commonly prescribed analgesic for patients with acute pain. Ketorolac is the leading parenteral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) in Canada commonly used in the Emergency Department (ED) and inpatient settings for acute abdominal pain and migraine headaches. Though it has safer adverse event profile than opioids, its use in children is off label as there are virtually no pediatric trials to inform this practice. Currently the recommended dosing for children is 0.5 mg/kg to a maximum dose of 30 mg. Recent trials with adults have shown no added analgesic benefit to higher doses of ketorolac, when comparing 10 mg to 15 mg or 30 mg, intravenous (IV). A lower dose will be desirable if it achieves similar reduction of pain, as it allows for safer cumulative daily dosing and lower rates of adverse events. This has led many physicians to change their adult practice to a maximum dose of 10 mg IV; however, despite their smaller size, most children continue to be exposed to doses of 30 mg IV, due to a lack of similar available evidence.

Research Question: In children aged 6 - 17 years, with moderate to severe pain (measured using the 11-point verbal numerical rating scale (VNRS)), who are prescribed IV Ketorolac by their treating physician, is low-dose IV Ketorolac (0.25 mg/kg/dose up to 10 mg OR 0.5 mg/kg/dose up to 10 mg) non-inferior (NI) to standard treatment (0.5 mg/kg/dose up to 30 mg) in reducing mean pain scores within a NI margin of 1?

Study Design: Our trial is a single-center, block randomized, double-dummy, double-blind, three-arm, controlled trial with parallel groups. Participants will include: (i) ≥6 years; (ii) with moderate-severe pain (defined as VNRS \> 4; (iii) seen in the ED or inpatient setting; and (iv) who have an IV access planned/available. These individuals will be randomized to an arm with active ketorolac and a 'placebo' ketorolac of a differing dose, to maintain blinding through the double-dummy design: (1) standard-dose ketorolac (0.5 mg/kg IV up to 30 mg IV) + low-dose ketorolac placebo; (2) low-dose ketorolac (0.25 mg/kg up IV up to 10 mg IV) + standard-dose ketorolac placebo; or (3) low-dose ketorolac (0.5 mg/kg IV up to 10 mg) + standard-dose ketorolac placebo.

Participants will be allowed any other non-NSAID rescue therapy at any point after our trial drugs are administered, based on clinical team discretion. Based on available adult literature, a chosen NI margin of 1 point (50% of the established MID), an expected mean difference of 0.2 on the VNRS, and standard deviation of 1.5 points, 57 participants will be needed in each group to achieve a 5% alpha at 80% power.

Primary Outcomes: Between each low-dose ketorolac group and standard group mean differences in pain as measured on VNRS at 60 minutes.

Summary: Acute pain requiring parenteral analgesia is very common amongst Canadian children.Despite data in adults and children supporting preferential NSAID use for acute pain, significant gaps in knowledge regarding safe and effective Ketorolac dosing in children still exists. The drug's superior adverse effect profile and lack of dependence and abuse potential, makes this an appropriate than opioids, and is not known to be a substance of misuse.","INTERVENTIONAL","RANDOMIZED","PARALLEL","TREATMENT",NA,NA,NA,"QUADRUPLE","Double dummy design",171,"ESTIMATED","Inclusion Criteria:

The clinical trial will be conducted in Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Poland and Sweden.

About 390 patients will be screened so that about 300 patients (150 patients per treatment group) will be randomized.

Vitex agnus-castus BNO 1095 20 mg is extracted from the fruits of the plant Vitex agnus-castus also called monk's pepper or chaste tree. Vitex agnus-castus BNO 1095 20 mg is currently marketed for the treatment of the premenstrual syndrome (PMS) which means repeated occurrence of physical, behavioral and psychological symptoms the days before the onset of menstruation, but it is not authorized for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea.

The study has 2 treatment groups. Patients in one group will receive Vitex agnus-castus BNO 1095 20 mg, and patients in the other group will receive a placebo. Patients will be randomly assigned 1:1 to one of the 2 groups. The chance to receive Vitex agnus-castus BNO 1095 is 50%. The study is double blinded, neither the patients nor the investigators know which product the patients are taking.

The study will last about 7 months for each patient. There will be 5 visits at the study site, and in addition the patients will receive 3 phone calls from the study site. On average, each study site visit will take about 2 hours and each phone call about half an hour.

The trial will include 3 phases: a screening and run-in phase of up to 2 menstrual cycles, a treatment phase of 4 menstrual cycles and a follow-up phase of 1 menstrual cycle. The length of each phase depends on the length of women's menstrual cycle. If their menstrual cycle is 28 days, the screening and run-in phase will take up to 59 days (slightly more than 2 menstrual cycles), the treatment phase 113 days (about 4 menstrual cycles), and the follow-up phase 28 days (1 menstrual cycle).

The main objective of this study is to determine if primary dysmenorrhea improves in women treated with Vitex agnus-castus BNO 1095 20 mg compared to placebo over a treatment duration of 3 menstrual cycles (cramping windows of Cycles 3-5).

Vitex agnus-castus BNO 1095 20 mg or placebo tablets are taken orally (means by mouth) once a day during the treatment phase.

If a patient usually takes pain relief medication for primary dysmenorrhea, the patient is allowed to continue taking this pain relief medication during study participation.

The patients will complete the dysmenorrhea daily diary (DysDD) every day in the evening. Depending on her bleeding status, the diary includes questions about menstrual bleeding, pieces of sanitary protection used, severity of the worst pain or cramps in the pelvic area on a numerical rating scale (NRS), intake of pain relief medication, and impact on daily life in an electronic diary (handheld device).

Additionally, the dysmenorrhea associated symptoms nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, weakness, fainting, and headache will be assessed by the patients on a NRS in the electronic diary on Days 1-3 of the menstrual cycle. Migraine will be assessed by the investigator at the clinical trial visits. The patient and investigator will assess the efficacy of treatment on a 5-point verbal rating scale at the end of treatment and at the end of the study (EoS).","INTERVENTIONAL","RANDOMIZED","PARALLEL","TREATMENT","randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled",NA,NA,"DOUBLE",NA,300,"ESTIMATED","Inclusion Criteria:

Differences in the degree of pain stimulation and pain sensitivity, weight and age differences, prior opioid use and tolerance, as well as the differences in bioavailability of various opioid formulations have been cited as causes for the wide variability in analgesia seen with opioids. However, a significant component of chronic pain may also be explained by genetic polymorphisms. Genetic information may explain the variability of responses and help predict more effective (or less dangerous) treatments and medication choices and doses. By identifying the genetic risks and the most effective analgesic for an individual patient, clinicians may be able to improve the efficacy of the pain treatments and medications and decrease the risk of iatrogenically-induced overdose, addiction, and death.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate how currently available genetic tests are being implemented in a pain management setting and whether this information results in benefits to patient care. Chronic pain patients receiving routine medical visits for their care will complete validated questionnaires to measure pain levels, disability indices, mental health, and quality of life measurements at each clinical visit.

2. To analyse the influence of aerobic exercise on the sleep quality and quality of life among the cohort compared with biofeedback and control exercise.

Hence the other main objective of this is to establish a aerobic exercise protocol for patients with migraine symptoms.","Habitual aerobic exercise has a major advantage of preventing or reducing symptoms of several chronic diseases and medical conditions. Aerobic or cardiovascular exercise by definition is a form of bodily movement that is fueled by aerobic energy-generating processes, where the energy demands of the exercise performed do not exceed the rate at which the cardiovascular system can supply oxygen to working muscles. Aerobic exercises have already proven to reduce frequency, duration, severity or associated disability in migraine. The physiology is that when one exercises, the body releases endorphins, which are the body's natural painkillers and natural anti-depressants chemicals called enkephalins. According to Centre of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), adult should exercise 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic exercise and 2 or more days a week of muscle strengthening each week for relief of migraine or primary headaches. Similarly, a study conducted comparing neck treatment and aerobic exercise concluded that 5 weeks of intervention for migraine patient responded with better outcomes. According to American migraine foundation the exercise program, should include the cardiorespiratory fitness, flexibility exercises and muscular strengthening.

Migraine is currently one of the leading causes of disease burden for women aged 15-44 years and affects an estimated 11% of the adult population globally, with a strong female predominance. Current approaches to therapy are primarily medication-based but are limited by often-inadequate effectiveness, high costs for many migraine-specific medications, and common side effects. In addition, there likely exist subtypes of migraine that may affect the likelihood of response to treatment, but these have been poorly investigated to-date. Furthermore, many patients are interested in exploring alternatives to pharmacological therapy for this functional disorder.

Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), a meditation-based intervention developed by Kabat-Zinn at the University of Massachusetts, has been increasingly shown to be effective for many patients with a variety of functional disorders. Recent small pilot studies suggest that MBSR may also provide an important benefit as an adjunctive therapy for patients with migraine headaches.

In preparation for a fully powered randomized controlled clinical trial of MBSR for patients with moderate-to-severe migraine headache, the investigators propose a detailed pilot/feasibility study to develop and test the clinical research methods required for a successful Phase III trial. The investigators will first identify a large number of migraineurs in the Northern California-based Sutter Health system using analytic tools previously developed by the group. Next, using latent class analysis, the investigators will identify subgroups of migraine patients defined by comorbidities. The investigators will then enroll 60 patients with a pattern of 4-20 headaches per month and randomize them to a full 8-week MBSR intervention with usual care or usual care alone, with follow-up at 4 months. The primary clinical outcome is change in headache frequency at 4 months, with several secondary outcomes, including assessments of pain, quality of life, and functional status.

As a feasibility study, the primary emphases of the trial are to demonstrate the investigators' ability to recruit and retain participants, to test whether their proposed enrollment criteria identify the appropriate patient population, to assess participants' levels of adherence to all aspects of the protocol, and to determine optimal methods for data collection. No tests of clinical effectiveness will be performed.

These headaches, in conjunction with other presenting symptoms such as nausea, diplopia, tinnitus, and cognitive deficits, often result in profound disability. SIH is considerably underreported due to pervasive misdiagnosis. Thus, while the estimated annual incidence is reported to be 5 in 100,000, the actual number is likely considerably greater.

The current standard-of-care treatment for SIH cases that are refractory to conservative measures (i.e. bed rest and hydration) is percutaneous epidural blood patching (EBP) of the spinal CSF leak. Percutaneous EBP can be performed in several ways: 1) with or without imaging guidance, 2) targeted to a site of known or suspected CSF leak or non-targeted, and 3) with or without the addition of fibrin glue sealant.

The leading theory for the mechanism behind percutaneous EBP treatment of SIH is that it creates a durable seal of the CSF leak resulting in normalization of CSF hydrodynamics and a resultant diminution in symptoms. Fibrin glue, a sealant used for treatment of unintended durotomies during neurosurgery, is thought to improve the likelihood of a successful patch over patches containing blood alone. Therefore, imaging-guided targeted delivery of patching material containing both blood and fibrin glue directly to the site of CSF leak, a novel therapy, is presumed to be the optimal therapy. For this reason, this procedure has become standard-of-care at many tertiary-care institutions over the past several years.

Our group has extensive experience with CT fluoroscopy-guided targeted blood and fibrin glue patching of proven CSF leaks in SIH patients. However, significant uncertainty remains with regard to the efficacy of this procedure due to a paucity of outcomes data and the absence of any prospective RCTs. In fact, nearly all of the current evidence for the treatment of SIH is found in the form of retrospective chart reviews. Given the growing recognition of SIH, the fact that a known subset of patients will have spontaneous resolution of symptoms, and the absence of clear evidence to guide treatment, there is a critical need to evaluate the efficacy of targeted patching with blood and fibrin glue with a prospective RCT. Fulfilling this unmet need forms the basis for this proposal. While determining the efficacy of the other types of EBPs is also important, we aim to begin by evaluating the efficacy of the presumed optimal therapy.","INTERVENTIONAL","RANDOMIZED","PARALLEL","TREATMENT",NA,NA,NA,"TRIPLE",NA,15,"ACTUAL","Inclusion Criteria:

By the time patients with benign headaches arrive in the emergency department, they have often failed non-invasive therapeutic attempts and providers are often left with few therapeutic options. Treatment of benign headache varies between providers, often including systemic medications with a multitude of possible side effects.

In recent years, there has been preliminary investigation into anesthetic injections for the undifferentiated headache patient presenting to the emergency department.

Since 2003, paraspinal muscle injections of bupivacaine have been used in emergency department patients with encouraging results. The mechanism of action is not clearly understood; however, it has been proposed that these injections affect the trigeminocervical complex hypothesized to play an integral role in headache physiology, similar to the same mechanism behind greater occipital nerve blocks used by neurologists.

To the best of the investigators knowledge, there has never been a prospective double-blinded randomized control trial addressing this novel approach to headache management. Even so, the topic of using bupivacaine to inject the paraspinal musculature of the cervical spine has gained wider recognition over the past year. The topic has been discussed heavily on emergency medicine blogs and podcasts. Additionally, online videos have been posted to educate emergency medicine providers on the injection technique. According to retrospective literature, clinical efficacy was observed with a significant proportion of the patients receiving therapeutic effect. These studies, along with anecdotal experience with the procedure at the investigators institution, have led to great excitement concerning the possibility of a new approach to emergency department headache management.

This is an outpatient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to confirm preliminary studies of the effectiveness of topiramate in the prevention of migraine attacks. The study is composed of 4 phases: pretreatment, double-blind treatment for 20 weeks, a blinded transition, and an open-label extension. During the pretreatment phase patients discontinue all medication for migraine prevention and keep a daily record of headache information in a diary. Patients with 3 to 8 migraines, but not more than 15 headache days, during the pretreatment phase continue in the double-blind treatment phase. In the 20-week double-blind treatment phase, oral topiramate tablets (or placebo) are taken daily beginning at 25 mg once daily for 1 week, increasing to twice daily doses of up to a maximum of 8 tablets (200 mg) per day during the 8-week titration period, and maintained at that dose during the 12-week maintenance period. Patients who successfully complete the double-blind therapy phase may continue in an open-label extension (32 weeks), during which the study medication (topiramate or placebo) will be decreased and simultaneously topiramate (open-label) will be administered at increasing doses. During the study, patients will maintain headache and medication records to document the following: occurrence and duration of headaches; severity of headache pain; associated symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, photophobia (avoidance and dread of light), phonophobia (fear of sound); and medication taken to relieve headache pain or symptoms. The primary measure of effectiveness is the percent reduction in the frequency of monthly migraine episodes during the entire double-blind treatment phase compared with the pretreatment phase. Other assessments of effectiveness include the percent of patients responding to treatment (\>= 50% reduction in average monthly migraine attacks) during the double-blind treatment phase compared with the pretreatment phase, the reduction in number of migraine days/month during treatment, and the reduction in severity and duration of migraines during treatment. Safety assessments include the incidence of adverse events throughout the study, and measurement of vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, body weight), physical examinations, and clinical laboratory tests (hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis) at specified intervals. The study hypothesis is that the decrease in the mean monthly migraine rate is greater in the topiramate group than in the placebo group.

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) represents a non-invasive electrical stimulation technique that modulates neural brain activity by means of low amplitude direct current trough surface electrodes.

Very little evidence is available on the potential effect of tDCS in medication overuse and in the management of medication overuse headache (MOH), a condition frequently associated to CM.

CM associated to MOH still represents a challenge for physicians and patients due to the high prevalence in the general population, the associated severe disability, and the high costs imposed by the treatment.

The aim of the study was to investigate the possible application of tDCS in the management of CM associated to MOH. The primary objective of this pilot study was therefore to investigate the efficacy of anodal tDCS delivered on the primary motor cortex (M1) as add-on therapy to an in-hospital detoxification protocol in subjects affected by CM and MOH. The secondary objective was to evaluate the possible changes induced by tDCS on conventional EEG in order to obtain further clues about the effects of tDCS on brain activity.","The study was a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial aimed at assessing the efficacy of five daily sessions of anodal t-DCS in add-on to a standardized in-hospital detoxification protocol in patients suffering from CM+MOH.

Twenty patients were enrolled among those consecutively attending the outpatient clinic of the IRCCS Mondino Foundation. All subjects underwent a screening visit with a physician of the Headache Science Centre of Mondino Institute. During the screening visit, a complete neurological and general examination was performed , and the inclusion/exclusion criteria were revised. Patients fulfilling criteria were enrolled in the baseline observation period for a month after an adequate training to monitor and record migraine and headache days, type and amount of acute medications and days of acute drug intake in an ad hoc diary. At the end of the baseline observation period, if inclusion/exclusion criteria were still satisfied, patients were randomized to the double-blind phase of the study (T0). To this end, patients were hospitalized on Mondays at the IRCCS Mondino Foundation for a 7-day detoxification protocol, that included: acute withdrawal of the overused drug and e.v. treatment with isotonic 0.9% NaCl saline 500 ml + cyanocobalamin 2500 mcg + folic acid 0.70 mg + nicotinamide 12 mg + ascorbic acid 150 mg + sodic glutathione 600 mg + delorazepam 0.5 mg administered b.i.d.

The day of hospital admission (T0), before the first infusion, patients were tested with a complete set of clinical scales and they completed the baseline EEG recording. After these procedures, the patients were randomized (1:1) to two different treatment groups: ""tDCS group"" or ""sham group"" and received 1 daily session of tDCS/sham stimulation for 5 consequent days (see below).

On day 5 (T1) patients underwent a follow-up EEG recording, administration of clinic scales for sleepiness, and attentional functions, evaluation of adverse events.

On day 7 patients were discharged from the hospital with or without the prescription of preventive medication (based on the physician judgement) and returned for a follow-up visit after 1 month (T2) and 6 months (T3). An addition EEG recording was obtained at T2.

Patients continued to record headache characteristic on the headache diary for the entire study observation period.

The study protocol was approved by the local Ethic Committee and all participants provided a written informed consent.

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) was delivered by a technician that was not otherwise involved in the management of patients. The managing physician were instead blind to the type of stimulation.

The technician used a specific battery-driven direct current stimulator (Newronika HDCstim, Newronika s.r.l.). The current was transferred by an approved saline-soaked pair of surface sponge electrodes (anode of 3x3 cm and cathode of 6x4 cm).

All the participants received daily stimulation sessions for 5 consecutive days (Monday to Friday). For the stimulation, the anode was placed over the primary motor cortex (M1), identified using the International 10-20 system for C3 (left M1) or C4 (right M1), and the cathode positioned over the contralateral supraorbital region (immediately below the Fp position of the 10-20 system). According to data from literature, in patients with a strict or prevalent (\>70% of attacks) unilateral headache the contralateral hemisphere was stimulated, instead in patients with bilateral or shifting headache the dominant hemisphere was conventionally stimulated.

Patients randomized to the tDCS group were treated with the following parameters: duration of stimulation of 20 minutes per session with a 2 mA intensity of anodal stimulation.

In the sham group, the stimulation setting was exactly the same but the stimulation intensity was set according to a ramping up/ramping down method and delivered only in the first and last 30 seconds of each session. This stimulation paradigm is insufficient to produce a meaningful therapeutic effect, but it is necessary to guarantee to blind condition as it mimics the possible initial tingling sensation associated with active stimulation. All participants were informed about possible feelings related to tDCS treatment, such as a tingly sensation under the electrodes at the beginning of the stimulation. These procedures adequately blind participants to their group allocation. At the end of the 5 days stimulation period a blind check was performed.

An EEG recording was performed at baseline (T0), at the end of the tDCS/sham treatment (T1), and after 1 month from hospital discharge (T2).

The EEG was recorded with 19 Ag/AgCl electrodes which were placed according to the 10-20 EEG International System.

The EEG registration was performed in the morning (between 9:00 a.m. and 11 a.m.), in a dedicated sound-attenuated room by a technician blinded to the study procedures. The subjects were instructed to remain awake with their eyes closed. The EEG was recorded for 10 min with a sampling rate of 1024 Hz and it was filtered between 0.4 and 70 Hz. A Notch filter was also applied to avoid 50 Hz interferences.

For the EEG signal analysis, the investigators used a spectral analysis through a fast Fourier transformation. The investigators evaluated the power spectral density in these frequency ranges: Delta (1-4 Hz), Theta (4-8 Hz), Alpha (8-12 Hz), Beta (12-30 Hz). The absolute band power values (µV2) for each frequency were computed for each active electrode (Fp1, Fp2, F3, F4, F7, F8, Fz, C3, C4, Cz, P3, P4, Pz, T3, T4, T5, T6, O1, O2), using Cz as ground reference.

For statistical purpose, the band power values were expressed as the percentage variation respect to baseline (normalized as 100%). Moreover, in patients with tDCS/sham stimulation of the right hemisphere the investigators performed an offline virtual right to left inversion all the electrodes of the right hemisphere. In this setting, unless differently specified, all the odd electrodes were ipsilateral to the side of stimulation, while all the even electrodes were contralateral to the side of stimulation.

At T0 and T2 time points all patients completed a set of questionnaires to assess migraine-related disability, quality of life, sleep disturbances, and psychological aspects. The set included:

* the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) test;
* the Headache Impact Test-6 (HIT-6);
* Visual Analogue Scale (VAS);
* the Migraine-Specific Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (MSQ);
* Short Form Health Survey (SF-36);
* Sleep Condition Indicator (SCI);
* Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI);
* Zung scale for anxiety;
* Zung scale for depression.

Moreover, before every EEG recording (T0, T1, and T2), patients were tested for their level of sleepiness, and attentional functions with:

* Stanford Sleepiness Scale: 1-item questionnaire, with a score that range from 1 (optimal alertness) to 7 (high level of sleepiness);
* Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT): the SDMT was administered to test attentive functions. Patients were trained to match numbers and abstract symbols, according to a coded key.

Migraines make up nearly 60% of all visits to a pediatric headache specialist. Studies have demonstrated the negative impact of having childhood migraine on overall quality of life is similar to pediatric cancer, heart disease and rheumatic disease. As the frequency of migraine attacks increase, so does proportionally the child's disability in lost school time and family and social interactions, all of which may lead in turn to economic disability. Studies estimate the health care costs are 70% higher for a family with a migraine than a non-migraine affected family, and direct medical costs for children with migraine are reported to be similar to those for adults. A study published in JAMA 2003 found that health care costs, work-related disability for parents and lost educational opportunity for the child leads to an annual economic impact in the US of approximately $36 billion due to both direct medical costs and lost productivity into adulthood.

Onaboutlinum (BOTOX) is currently FDA approved as a very successful treatment to prevent migraines in adults, however not yet children. Current treatments for migraine in children appear to be insufficient. No trials currently exist in literature prospectively studying onabotulinumtoxinA for efficacy and/or safety for indication of pediatric migraine, although significant contributions have been made by retrospective case series over the last 10 years.

This research will be the first investigator-initiated study to study BOTOX (R) in children prospectively in a randomized controlled placebo, cross-over study.

Pprophylactic treatment of migraines is an important part of the total management of migraine patients, having twofold goals: i) to reduce the frequency, painfulness, and/or duration of migraines, and ii) to increase the effectiveness of abortive therapy. During the past several decades, a large number of optional modalities have been tested as preventive measures of migraine attacks. Not unexpectedly, the effects of any such preventive therapies are highly variable, and in many patients, the attack frequency is not under satisfactory control. Many of these drugs also have untoward side effects that offset their potential benefits.

Recently, spontaneous case testimonials were received by Biohit Oyj from migraine patients, reporting that our new medical device, Acetium™ capsule (containing 100mg L-cysteine, developed for inactivation of acetaldehyde in the stomach contents after alcohol intake), proved to be highly effective against migraine attacks. Their headache attacks disappeared almost immediately after onset of L-cysteine administration, all of them remaining in complete remission for several months up to several years by now.

These spontaneous testimonials prompted us to formulate a novel study hypothesis that could possibly explain these dramatic effects of L-cysteine in migraine prevention, to be tested in this RCT. This novel hypothesis is starting from the fact that, swelling and dilatation of cerebral blood vessels is necessary to provoke the attack in this vascular-type of headache.

It is known that Nitric Oxide (NO) is the final trigger of migraine attack, operating through phosphorylated protein kinase G (PKG) and Ca2+ channels, slowing the influx of calcium into the cell, which leads to smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation. Histamine is a potent inducer of NO Synthase, making NO available locally on the vasculature, acting through endothelial H1-receptors. Histamine is synthesized from histidine in tissue mast cells, which are ubiquitous cells and their activation e.g. in the meninges has long been suspected to be involved in generating migraine headaches. Finally, one of the potent liberators of histamine from the mast cells is acetaldehyde, which, in turn, is effectively inactivated by L-cysteine (Acetium capsule). This led us to rational that by eliminating acetaldehyde in the stomach, L-cysteine could block (or reduce below the threshold levels) histamine liberation from the tissue mast cells and ECL cells in the stomach, thus arresting its multitude of functions, of which vasodilatation is critically involved in the migraine attack.

Objective: To validate the novel hypothesis that daily use of L-cysteine is an effective means to decrease the frequency of (or completely abort) the headache attacks in migraine patients.

Study design: A double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled multi-centre trial comparing Acetium capsules (100mg L-cysteine, twice a day) and placebo in prevention of migraine attacks during a 3-month trial period. A cohort of 200 voluntary subjects (women and men, with aural or non-aural migraine) are invited through the Finnish Migraine Association (FMA), to participate in the study. To be eligible, the subjects should: i) have the attack frequency of 2-8 times per month, ii) have had migraine for at least 1 year, iii) have the onset of their migraine before 50 years of age, iv) be between 18 and 65 years of age, and v) have a minimum of co-morbidity. Eligible patients are allowed (if they want) to continue their current migraine prophylactic medication prior to study entry. Before enrolment in the cohort, all subjects are requested to sign a written consent. The study protocol will be subjected for approval by the Regional Committee on Medical Research Ethics (HUS).

Methods: A 3-month retrospective history and 1-month prospective baseline (run-in) period is used to assess the baseline attack frequency. The study setting is actually triple-blinded (participant-blind, investigator-blind, sponsor-blind). Placebo preparation with design and package identical to the test preparation will be used. Parallel group design instead of cross-over design is used. Randomization will be performed using a random number generator, with blocks size of 4, and creating unique randomization codes for each subject. The stratified randomization is based on the attack frequency is used as the stratification variable, using 4 attacks per month as the cut-off for low-and high frequency.

The treatment period in both study arms will be 3 months. The participants should use (and accurately report) their usual symptomatic or acute treatment, because not anticipated to interfere with the study medication. During the 3-month treatment period, participants will be evaluated at monthly intervals by the study coordinator. As determined by the final study compliance, data analyses might be necessary separately for i) Per Protocol (PePr), and ii) Intention-to-treat (ITT) groups.

In addition to the baseline assessment of attack frequency, each subject will be requested to fill in a structured Questionnaire recoding their detailed migraine history and other pertinent data on potential triggers, to be used as covariates in multivariate analysis. The headache diary is the main research tool used to monitor the efficacy of the test preparations, recording all predefined assessment measures (efficacy, tolerability and safety). These diaries are submitted to the study monitor on each FU visit, to confirm the compliance.

In statistical analysis, both conventional techniques (e.g. non-parametric paired-samples and non-paired samples t-test), and more sophisticated methods will be used. The latter include i) life-table methods like Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards regression, as well as ii) generalized linear models (GEE and panel Poisson) and as a new technique in migraine RCTs, a competing risks regression, to model the natural outcomes of migraine during the intervention. This study (n=100 per study arm) is adequately powered (Type II error 0.80, type I error 0.05) to detect a true difference in attack frequency between 4 attacks/month in the placebo and 2.4 attacks/month in the Acetium arm, i.e., the difference in effect size of 1.6 attacks. Given that the study subjects are selected among patients with 2-8 monthly attacks, there figures seem reasonable estimates for the basis of these power calculations.

Specific aims: The null hypothesis of the study implicates that l-cysteine is no better than placebo in migraine prophylaxis during the intervention period of 3 months. Rejection or not of the null hypothesis is based on comparison of the two arms for two primary study endpoints and (to lesser extent) for a series of secondary endpoints. The two primary study endpoints (efficacy measures) are: a) Number of migraine attacks (NMA) per evaluation interval (1 month), and ii) Number of migraine days (NMD) per evaluation period. Potentially useful secondary endpoints include: i) Intensity of headache (4-tier nominal scale); ii) Attack duration in hours (potentially biased by treatment); iii) Drug consumption for symptomatic or acute treatment (NMDs treated with abortive agents and the number of drug administrations for acute therapy); iv) Patients' preferences and satisfaction; v) Responder rate (proportion of study subjects with \>50% improvement in NMA or NMD, as compared to baseline values).

Study execution and time table: Meanwhile the final protocol is under evaluation for ethical approval by HUS, preparatory measures have been taken by informing the FMA about the planned study and asking their co-operation in encouraging the interested migraine patients to contact the study coordinator. Given the preliminary interest shown by the FMA, we are optimistic that the required cohort of volunteers can be enrolled within a short time, most likely by the end of 2013. Because each study subject shall complete only a 3-month trial period, preceded by 1-month run-in time, we expect that the study will be completed during the second half of 2014.

Impact of the study: Given that L-cysteine is a natural (semi-essential) amino acid, converted to inert substance (MTCA) in the alimentary tract, it would comprise an ideal means to conduct migraine prophylaxis for years, without concern about the side effects that are inherent to many of the current treatment modalities. If the efficacy is proved in this formal RCT, the concept of using Acetium capsules in prophylactic treatment of migraines would represent a major step forward in a better clinical control of these frequently intractable syndromes.","INTERVENTIONAL","RANDOMIZED","PARALLEL","TREATMENT",NA,NA,NA,"QUADRUPLE",NA,200,"ESTIMATED","Inclusion Criteria:

Hypothesis: A series of treatments with propranolol, in comparison to placebo, will produce a significant reduction in PTSD symptom severity in participants with chronic PTSD.

Study Design: This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study. Methodology: Twenty-five participants per group with chronic PTSD will be recruited. On their first visit psychodiagnostic and psychometric evaluation will take place. In addition, script-preparation for the script-driven imagery procedure will occur. Following this, the participants will return each week for a period of 6 weeks to participate in the reactivation sessions with propranolol or placebo (participants assigned to the propranolol condition will receive propranolol throughout, and participants assigned to the placebo condition will receive placebo throughout). Two weeks later, the participants will return for a follow-up of the psychodiagnostic and psychometric evaluation, as well as psychophysiological assessment using script-driven imagery procedure.

Data Analysis: A two-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures will be performed on study completers. The Drug factor will have two levels: propranolol and placebo. The Time factor will have two levels: pre-treatment and post-treatment. We predict a significant Drug x Time interaction, more precisely a greater decrease in PTSD severity in the propranolol than in the placebo group. The psychophysiological data will be contrasted to a normative cutoff score for PTSD.","Historical background. Recent animal research indicates that retrieval returns a consolidated memory, or some aspect(s) of it, to a labile state from which it must be restabilized in order to persist. This process is called reconsolidation, although it is not identical to consolidation. Support for reconsolidation comes from experiments in a variety of species ranging from snails to humans; in appetitive, aversive and neutral tasks; and using a broad range of approaches, including systemic or localized drug administration, gene manipulation, and interference by new learning. Memory impairments due to blocked reconsolidation can be long-lasting. Reconsolidation impairments are distinct from extinction in that they can be made to occur even when a reinforced trial is used to reactivate the memory, do not show renewal after contextual shift, can be double-dissociated from extinction, and have distinct neurochemical signatures from extinction. To date there has only been a single, published, controlled study supporting reconsolidation, and its blockade, in humans. That study involved weakening the consolidated memory of a simple motor sequence by presenting a conflicting sequence after reactivation of the memory of the original sequence.

According to a translational model of the pathogenesis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a psychologically traumatic event overstimulates endogenous stress hormones, which in turn overly strengthen consolidation of the memory of the event, leading to an excessively powerful and persistent memory that is too easily activated, with consequent anxiety and dysfunction. Animal and human data indicate that the memory-modulating effects of stress hormones are mediated by noradrenergic activity in the amygdala and can be opposed by a β-adrenergic blocker such as propranolol. Administration of propranolol in the immediate aftermath of a psychologically traumatic event reduces the strength of its memory, as manifest in lower physiological responding during script-driven mental imagery of the event measured 3 months later, and lower self-reported PTSD symptoms measured 2 months later.

According to the above model, there exists a window of opportunity for influencing the consolidation of the traumatic event into long-term memory. Once this window has closed, the memory trace is no longer labile, and β-blockers would no longer be able to exert their anti-PTSD effect. Attempting to prevent PTSD by blocking consolidation of the traumatic memory (or some aspects of it) is subject to the formidable limitation that most cases are unlikely to receive clinical attention until long after this window of opportunity has shut. In persons who have developed PTSD, this would have happened weeks, months, or years earlier. However, if a traumatic memory undergoes reconsolidation when it is reactivated, this could re-open the window of opportunity to influence the memory pharmacologically. The post-reactivation administration of propranolol could reduce the strength of a traumatic memory by blocking reconsolidation in a manner parallel to reducing its strength immediately following its occurrence by blocking consolidation. In support of this possibility, consolidated memories for aversive tasks in animals have been shown to become sensitive to β-blockade after reactivation. Specifically, administration of propranolol following reactivation has been found to reduce inhibitory avoidance and auditory fear conditioning; the latter impairment was stable for one month. These results demonstrate in rodents that aversively conditioned memories when reactivated become sensitive to the effects of propranolol.

Previous studies supporting the proposed research. In a preliminary study, we employed a validated psychophysiological script-driven imagery technique to study 19 participants with chronic PTSD resulting from various psychologically traumatic events. Physiological responses during traumatic imagery have been shown to reliably discriminate PTSD from non-PTSD psychological trauma victims, leading to the inclusion of the PTSD criterion ""physiological reactivity on exposure to internal cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event"" in the current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV). Each participant described the traumatic event that caused their PTSD; this served to reactivate the traumatic memory. Immediately thereafter, the participant received either oral 40 mg short-acting propranolol followed 2 hours later by oral 60 mg long-acting propranolol (n = 9), or look-alike placebo capsules (n = 10), randomized and double-blind. Group demographic and psychometric means for the two groups were highly similar. A trained research assistant composed scripts portraying the event in the participant's own words and recorded them for playback in the laboratory.

One week later, the participant listened to an audio recording of their personal traumatic event in the psychophysiology laboratory and imagined the event as if it were happening to them again, while heart rate (HR), skin conductance (SC), and left corrugator (facial frowning muscle) electromyogram (EMG) responses were measured. Overall physiological responding during mental imagery of the traumatic event was significantly smaller in the PTSD participants who had received propranolol a week earlier compared to those who had received placebo (multivariate p = .007). Drug condition accounted for an impressive 49% of the variance in overall physiological responding. The univariate analyses indicated that HR and SC, but not EMG, responses were significantly smaller in the propranolol compared to the placebo participants. The mean HR and SC responses of the placebo participants were above the normative cut-offs for PTSD (dashed lines), whereas the mean HR and SC responses of the propranolol participants were below the normative PTSD cut-offs. The mean EMG responses of both groups fell below the normative PTSD cut-off. The observed effect sizes (in terms of Cohen's d, i.e., the difference in group means divided by the pooled standard deviation) were all in the predicted direction. By conventional standards, these effect sizes were very large for SC, large for HR, but small for EMG. The psychophysiological results of the present study along with those of the previously reported study in which propranolol was administered in the immediate aftermath of the traumatic event indicate that post-reactivation propranolol recapitulates its effects on consolidation.

Self-reported PTSD symptoms measured by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised showed a significant decline in the propranolol participants (19%), but not in the placebo participants (11%). However, the Group x Time interaction was not statistically significant, and the effect size was only moderate. Certainly the decline in self-reported PTSD symptoms in the propranolol group was less than the ""decline"" in physiological responses during traumatic imagery (taking the placebo group's responses as the comparison in the absence a baseline physiological measurement). However, because of their subjective nature, symptom self-reports are vulnerable to a number of potentially confounding factors, including demand effects, long-standing beliefs and expectations about oneself and one's situation, incorporating one's symptoms into one's identity, and secondary gain. All these factors may make changing self-reports more difficult than changing physiological responses, which more directly access changes in the strength of traumatic memories. It may be that anything greater than moderate improvement in PTSD symptoms is too much to ask of a single session and a single dose of propranolol.

Rationale behind the proposed research. The preliminary results described above suggest that using pharmacological consolidation blockers in conjunction with memory reactivation could have important implications for therapy. Currently cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) which relies heavily on exposure and extinction, is the psychotherapeutic treatment of choice for anxiety disorders, including PTSD. However, its beneficial effects on PTSD -like those of drug treatment- are partial, with only one-third of patients showing lasting, clinically meaningful improvement. Modulating reconsolidation may have certain advantages over this approach. Reconsolidation blockade targets the traumatic memory directly, whereas extinction attempts to inhibit the traumatic memory through new (inhibitory) learning. There are two important drawbacks to extinction as a therapy. First, because extinction only inhibits the underlying fear memory, it will tend to spontaneously recover with the passage of time. Second, extinction is context-dependent. Thus, cognitive behavioral therapists must find ways of making extinction-based therapy context-independent and long-lasting. Otherwise, beneficial effects acquired in the office will be lost at home or over time. In contrast, reconsolidation has the theoretical advantage that impairments induced by its blockade are context-independent and long-lasting. From the practical standpoint, CBT typically requires periods of lengthy exposure to the traumatic memory or feared situation to promote extinction. In the case of reconsolidation blockade, animal research suggests that briefer exposure is more suitable.

A report of a case series of 15 patients suffering from various mental disorders who were treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) claimed that when the ECT was administered during the reactivation of a memory, obsession, or hallucination, it was substantially more effective. This is roughly consistent with the possibility that psychiatric symptoms can be made to undergo reconsolidation blockade. However, the patients had a long history of psychopathology and ECT treatment, which, along with the absence of quantitative outcome measures and appropriate controls, precluded firm conclusions. Moreover, the treatment involved administration of ECT to awake patients. The practical advantage of pharmacological reconsolidation blockade over such a gross approach is obvious.","INTERVENTIONAL","RANDOMIZED","CROSSOVER","TREATMENT",NA,NA,NA,"QUADRUPLE",NA,50,"ESTIMATED","Inclusion Criteria:

It has important antioxidant properties. Both beta-alanine and GABA are neurotransmitters, suggesting that cleavage of this dipeptide by carnosine dipeptidase 1 (CNDP1) may have important regulatory functions in vivo.

Drug: Homocarnosine is not available. Carnosine (beta-alanine - histidine) is an over-the-counter dietary supplement that shares the antioxidant properties. We proposed that oral carnosine would be absorbed from the gut, cross the blood brain barrier, reduce presumed brain oxidant stress that participated in illness pathology, and improve subject health.

Hypothesis: Carnosine supplementation for 12 weeks by mouth in Gulf War Illness subjects would improve cognitive and other outcomes compared to placebo treatment.

Subjects: Gulf War Illness subjects met 1996 Fukuda criteria for Chronic Multisymptom Illness.

This broad complex of functional disorders often affects the face and jaws causing chronic pain, earaches, headaches, migraines, neck pain, and dysfunction in many people 1,2,3,4,5,6. Conservative treatment for TMD is similar to that of other musculoskeletal conditions. Pharmacologic therapy includes the use of anti-inflammatory medications, muscle relaxants, or opioid analgesics7,8,9,10. Physical treatments comprise of dental splints, directed physiotherapy, moist heat therapy, soft diet, massage and acupuncture11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25. At the extreme end of the spectrum, surgical management includes arthrocentesis, arthroscopy and open joint procedures26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44. Some patients can find relief with a combination of these previously mentioned interventions; however, none of these have been proven to be consistently effective. Open joint procedures are not reversible while anti-inflammatory medications and narcotics can have undesirable side effects on the gastrointestinal and central nervous system, respectively. Furthermore, many patients suffering from severe chronic pain do not feel relief with even the strongest narcotic analgesics45,46.

TMD has a complex etiology consisting of components from internal derangement of the joint, arthralgia and/or a component of myofascial pain and muscle hyperactivity1,2,3,4. A treatment that has high specificity and low side effects directed solely at the muscular aspect, which presents with signs and symptoms of trigger points, clenching, and bruxism, could produce another avenue of intervention with significant potential. Recently, the use of botulinum toxin has proven effective and has the potential to be such an agent for treatment with patients suffering from TMD and other orofacial pain conditions47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55.

Botulinum toxins are exotoxins derived from Clostridium botulinum, a gram-positive, anaerobic, spore-forming organism. There are 8 different subtypes; type A (BTX-A) has been used in recent studies for the treatment of motor disorders such as cervical dystonia or the hyperactive muscular component of TMD53,54,55. The specific method of action of botulinum toxin is on peripheral synapses. In the synaptic cleft, the botulinum toxin is brought into the presynaptic cell by endocytosis. It acts by blocking the calcium induced release of acetylcholine by selective proteolysis of synaptomal-associated proteins (SNAP)47,48,4,50,51,52,53,54,55. Inhibition of acytelcholine thus causes an inhibition of muscular hyperactivity.

Botulinum toxin has a number of indications approved by the Food and Drug Administration such as the therapeutic treatment for cervical dystonia, cosmetic use such as glabellar lines and wide spectrum of off-label uses such as extracervical spasticities, cerebral palsy, post stroke spasticity, neurologic, dermatologic, and gastrointestinal disorders56. Off-label use of a licensed drug or biologic product occurs with a wide range of products57,58,59.

Objective of the Study We aim to treat TMD of muscular origin using Botulinum toxin injections in the trigger points.

Method Our study will enroll selective patients attending the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery clinic at the Health Sciences Center and at the University of Manitoba College of Dentistry over a 2-year period. Subjects will be recruited from referrals coming to the Health Sciences Center and College of Dentistry. The design will be prospective study following subjective outcomes such as pain and orofacial function on a visual analog scale as well as objective outcomes such as maximal interincisal mouth opening, tenderness to palpation to the temporalis and masseter muscles, maximal bite force measured by electromyogram and the reduction in muscle bulk due to muscle disuse atrophy. These outcomes have an appreciable affect on the patient's quality of life and provide subjective and objective measurements for analysis and study.

Inclusion criteria for patient's enrolled in this study include: participant's with trigger points in their masticatory muscles including, but not limited to: masseter and temporalis either bilateral or unilateral and secondly, have tried conservative management for at least 3 months and have shown to be refractory to these interventions. Exclusion criteria include: participant's that do not satisfy the inclusion criteria, currently are breastfeeding or pregnant, participant's whose TMD is not muscular in origin, inability to speak or understand English, the inability to provide meaningful informed consent due to physical, cognitive or psychiatric disability, a previous known allergy to Botulinum toxin, multiple sclerosis, pre-existing neuromuscular disorders, Lambert-Eaton syndrome, or chronic centrally mediated neuralgic pain patients.

Before enrollment, informed consent will be obtained from each patient. Informed consent will consist of a thorough initial evaluation and interview. If the patient is assessed to be appropriate for the study the patient will be informed of all risks and potential consequences of the study. Additional information will be given regarding benefits, cost and time required. During the informed consent, the principal investigator and at least one supervisor will be in attendance to answer any questions. Patients will be allowed time to think about their decision and discuss with family members and their family physician. A future appointment can be made to obtain consent and will be witnessed by the principal investigator, a supervisor and an OMFS assistant that has no connection with the study.

On the initial assessment, multiple measurements will be taken (see clinical assessment form attached). Additionally, an appointment will be made for the patient to have their maximal bite force registered pre-injection with the use of EMG.

BTX-A will be reconstituted as directed by the manufacturer. 2.5 mL of diluent (0.9% Saline) per 100 U vial will be used to reconstitute the solution while swirling. This creates a solution with a concentration of 4 U/0.1 mL. Patients will be seated and all usual precautions of sterility and skin preparation will be completed (i.e. alcohol wipes) Injections will be administered unilateral and/or bilaterally in accordance with the topography of the corresponding muscles (temporalis and masseter) into areas of maximal tenderness and pain. Plastic single use insulin syringes with 30 gauge needles will be used to inject 30 U intramuscularly into each masseter, divided evenly into 5 sites and 20 U will be injected into each temporalis, divided evenly over 5 sites. Injections will be completed by the principal investigator and supervisors who will be trained in botulinum toxin injections.

Patients will have scheduled follow ups at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months post-injection. An additional follow up call will be made the next day after injection. The clinical assessment form will be used by the principal investigator to take measurements at each follow up appointment, except EMG readings which will only be done at the initial assessment and 3 month follow up appointment. This will provide a total of 5 assessments (including the initial assessment). During this time period, patients will be asked to stop any treatment for their TMD other than analgesics as required.

Subjective pain scores will be assessed on a visual analog scale (VAS) where 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst facial or jaw pain they've ever experience. Subjective functional assessments will also be assessed with VAS where 0 means no limitation and 10 indicates severe limitation with scales for chewing, drinking, exercising, eating hard food, eating soft food, smiling or laughing, cleaning their teeth, yawning, swallowing and talking. Objectively, range of motion will be assessed with a Boley gauge between the same upper and lower incisor each time. Palpation tenderness will be objectively assessed in bilateral temporalis and masseter muscles. Pain to pressure will be ranked from 0 to 5, with 0 indicating no pain and 5 representing extreme debilitating pain. Addition of each score will give a composite score of the overall facial tenderness out of a maximal score of 24 (2 areas X 6 scores X bilaterally). All assessments will be completed by the same examiner every time at the same time of day. Lastly, a measurement of the facial width will be taken. A point inferior to each ear lobule bilaterally will be marked as well as a point on the menton will be chosen and recorded. The distance unilaterally from one lobule to menton will be measured for left and right sides and a total distance will also be calculated to assess facial width. This will be used to determine the cosmetic change due to disuse atrophy 60.

Side effects may include, but are not limited to: transient facial asymmetry during dynamic movements, dysphagia, ptosis, erythematous discoloration or edema at the injection site, rash, and difficulty chewing hard food 61. Every attempt will be made to insure injection of the botulinum in the appropriate site. Aspiration before each injection will help prevent any intravascular and systemic effects while proper patient positioning and proper site identification will help prevent unwanted side effects such as ptosis. If a rash develops, Benadryl will be the first line medication given immediately followed by a several day course of Benadryl at home. In the case of an emergent reaction, adequate management would be undertaken at the clinic and referral to an appropriate service if necessary. Due to passage across the placenta, the use during pregnancy is also contraindicated. All patient's who are currently breastfeeding or pregnant will be excluded from the study62.

Funding for the study will be provided by application to research grants through The University of Manitoba and the Canadian Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

Anticipated results We expect trigger points in these patients to disappear and the associated muscles to become partially paralyzed and relaxed. Consequently, we expect that the TMJ loading will be reduced and that the patient's overall functional ability will increase. We also expect that muscular hypertrophy volume from hyperactivity will decrease due to disuse atrophy and impact their cosmetic image positively. Overall, we hope these changes will result in a reduction in pain and headaches which will consequently improve the participant's diet, nutrition, psychological well being and quality of life.

We expect this study will be published in the International Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and that results will be presented at the International meeting of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons in 2018.","INTERVENTIONAL","NA","SINGLE_GROUP","TREATMENT",NA,NA,NA,"NONE",NA,40,"ESTIMATED","Inclusion Criteria:
